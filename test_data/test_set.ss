ur0116181/	\tt0800080	edward norton is right & wrong . <sssss> this movie could have used more of him in it -lrb- when the dvd comes out i hope they include `` his cut '' if it exist -rrb- , but he is wrong for not promoting this movie . <sssss> this re-boot is a blast to watch . <sssss> i actually liked much of ang lee 's version but only in fits & starts . <sssss> this hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags . <sssss> the fx are spectacular & sometimes inspired -- every part of the production is great . <sssss> the battle scenes are ferocious . <sssss> i never tired of watching mean green do his thing , but i guess thats the point . <sssss> the movie makers knew when to cut the action . <sssss> however -- like iron man -- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism , but , come to think of it , all 3 spideys & x-men + batman begins -lrb- & returns -rrb- also featured really fine & often great acting . <sssss> and this hulk could 've used more of it . <sssss> norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working . <sssss> there are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief . <sssss> william hurt makes a fine foe . <sssss> and , so help me movie gods , liv tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name `` bruce '' . <sssss> overall this movie rocks . <sssss> and i thought all movies released b4 july 18th were just until the dark knight arrives . <sssss> thank you tony stark , indy & bruce banner for proving me wrong .
ur0116181/	\tt0120789	it is no surprise that gary ross -- the writer of big and dave -- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen , but what is surprising is the level of directorial stewardship that he brings to a very complex undertaking . <sssss> pleasantville is a wonderful laugh-out-loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . <sssss> but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . <sssss> any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . <sssss> the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . <sssss> tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . <sssss> maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . <sssss> witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . <sssss> and allen , like she did in face/off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . <sssss> this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . <sssss> the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i 've ever seen . <sssss> i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . <sssss> it is fantastic . <sssss> the seamless blend of color and black-and-white ceases to become an issue very early on . <sssss> you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . <sssss> fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . <sssss> some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . <sssss> my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . <sssss> next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far .
ur0116181/	\tt0077416	there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . <sssss> michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . <sssss> the survivors suffer more than the dead . <sssss> i know a lot of knee-jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . <sssss> this film could have been set in any war . <sssss> i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . <sssss> -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . <sssss> -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . <sssss> and of course the acting was brilliant . <sssss> deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . <sssss> but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? <sssss> the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . <sssss> his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . <sssss> the deerhunter is easily one of the top 20 films i 've ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . <sssss> its oscars were richly deserved .
ur0550732/	\tt0405159	2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and i. million dollar baby is a sure fire acadamey award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win . <sssss> everything about this movie from the writing , directing , acting and even the music by clint eastwood is brilliant . <sssss> hillary swank is once again one of our best actresses . <sssss> . <sssss> do n't know why she does n't make more movies and do some as a `` real lady '' which she certainly is . <sssss> her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role . <sssss> the chemistry between her and the fabulous clint eastwood who i believe is past 70 years old is wonderful . <sssss> clint is simply great in anything that he does , from those old spaghetti westerns , to dirty harry to the comedies , acting , directing , singing , you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else . <sssss> he is a fall back to the greats of hollywood . <sssss> what can you say about morgan freeman . <sssss> i can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied . <sssss> he is mesmerizing with his tones . <sssss> as an actor , he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting . <sssss> he is one of the finest actors in hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber . <sssss> he is great as the go between with clint eastwood and hillary swank in this movie and he does it with such ease . <sssss> i would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves .
ur0550732/	\tt0458352	we start all of our reviews with the following information . <sssss> my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . <sssss> recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! <sssss> so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . <sssss> the point of this is that critics count for zero . <sssss> your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . <sssss> the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! <sssss> we never ever listen or read the critics . <sssss> we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . <sssss> well enough about that . <sssss> a very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms . <sssss> dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick . <sssss> meryl streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the `` super bitch '' of the fashion magazine business . <sssss> stanley tucci is his usual wonderful self as the `` gay '' assistant . <sssss> anne hathaway continues to grow as an actress .
ur0550732/	\tt0368709	this is another movie that shows that critics are overworked and just plain out of touch . <sssss> a critic by definition has to see every movie , not just the ones they want to see . <sssss> so unlike us real people , we pick what we want to see . <sssss> we -lrb- my wife and i -rrb- have lifetime free passes to go and see any movie we want to . <sssss> we pick and choose what we want to see , not see everything even though it is free . <sssss> critics have not liked this movie at all . <sssss> why ? <sssss> some of them are 60 years old , some do n't like orlando , or ms. dunn or who knows why . <sssss> we look at a movie to get our two hours of being entertained . <sssss> not anymore , not any less . <sssss> i do n't know what they look for ? <sssss> we loved this movie , i never saw a movie with orlando bloom and so i have no bias . <sssss> my wife however , loves him and saw him umpteen times on the tube this past week . <sssss> he was terrific in this role as was . <sssss> it was a most enjoyable movie and we got our monies worth . <sssss> do n't listen to the critics . <sssss> be your own critic .

ur0365713/	\tt0115988	what a good film . <sssss> this was acted superbly by daniel day lewis and winona rider and had me on the edge of my seat . <sssss> you could really feel for the characters and what they were fighting for . <sssss> this film confirms to me what i have always felt myself , that religion is full of hate and murder and is the single biggest reason why people suffer around the world . <sssss> a must see film . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0252866	american pie 2 is a film that was made simply because of the success of the first film . <sssss> the problem with this is that they forgot to write a script that was either funny or interesting . <sssss> in fact this film is a total bore that copies jokes from 100 other teen comedies . <sssss> it is predictable and pointless . <sssss> i remember looking at the clock on the dvd player and it said 61 minutes before anything remotely funny happened -lrb- the lesbian scene -rrb- and this could have been done much better . <sssss> i am completely sick of films that involve american teenagers calling themselves dudes and leering over boobed teenage girls . <sssss> i suspect neither really exist in the states . <sssss> if you liked the first film the best way i can describe this is that it is just the same with the funny bits taken out . <sssss> 3 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0267626	if you can forget harrison ford 's really naff russian accent for a moment you find a really good thriller here . <sssss> a film that is well worth watching and at no point has you looking at the clock even though it is over 2 hours long . <sssss> the acting from all the cast is very and you do feel that you are on the submarine everything that is going on.it is good to see a hollywood film made seeing the russian instead of the us one . <sssss> the make up deserves a mention too , the scenes at the end when we see liam neilson and harrison ford as old men are the best i have seen at making an actor look old . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0257044	when was the last time tom hanks made a bad film or has he ever made a bad film ? <sssss> this is definately in the brilliant hanks film bracket as so many of his film are but what strikes me about road to perdition is that apart from the great acting from all the cast the direction is fantastic . <sssss> without going into what the film is about this film look so fantastic . <sssss> some would say it is a little dark and maybe even depressing but i would say forget that . <sssss> if you like a film with a brilliant story , fantastic acting , brilliant direction and heartbreaking then this is for you . <sssss> its not all action in fact the first half hour could be described as a little slow but this can be forgiven because this without doubt will be one of the best films you will see all year . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0132342	the mummy is a typical universal studios movie . <sssss> it is entertaining , crammed with special affects and all too predictable.i did enjoy this movie for what it was , an action comic book adventure . <sssss> it is far from a horror movie , which is what the old mummy movies main problem i have with this film is the trailers for it . <sssss> once you have seen them you have seen the best special affect the film has to offer . <sssss> i would still recomend it for the kids and most adults . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0084726	the wrath of khan is widely excepted as one of the very good star trek movies and i cant help but agree . <sssss> i have how i felt when i first saw this film but even now it leaves a lump in the throat so then it must have had more of an affect on my considering at the time we never knew that spock was to return . <sssss> like star trek the motion picture i have to yet again say how dated the film looks compared to it 's counterpart star wars but dont think this is as bad as the first star trek film because it is n't . <sssss> the acting is better , there is actually a storyline this time , and a good one at that . <sssss> i 'm not sure about kirsty alley in this , she somehow does not fit the star trek criteria and like in the first movie they have tried to spice the film up by adding an extra female member of the crew . <sssss> each are highly forgetable . <sssss> all in all an entertaining movie . <sssss> 7 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0120789	pleasantville is story of how peoples of a perfect life are not always as perfect as they is the story of a brother and sister who get sucked into a tv show about a pleasant town with perfect people who lead angelic lives and how the two peoples values and own way of life gradually rub this is for the better it is up to you to judge . <sssss> the from old pleasantville to the new pleasantville is very clever . <sssss> the old turn from black and white into colour to show the progression . <sssss> this film was a little slushy and maybe a bit to long but over all not bad . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0209144	momento is like no other movie i have ever seen or am likely to ever see . <sssss> this a film that that is fairly easy to describe the outline of the plot but almost impossible to describe the story . <sssss> guy pierce plays an insurance investigator who suffers from short term memory loss after a bash on the head during the murder of his wife . <sssss> this means that he ca n't retain any memories for more than 5 minutes although he can remember eveything before the accident . <sssss> with this affliction he tries to find the killer of his wife to inflict revenge . <sssss> the way the film plays out is quite brilliant . <sssss> it has little pattern yet it is so watchable simply because all the time you are trying to work out what it going . <sssss> it is like the viewer has the same term memory loss as the main it is almost impossible to know where you are in the story it is not irritating in the way some films can be when the story is to complicated . <sssss> guy pierce is superb and pulls this off to i think a big congratulation goes to christopher and jonathon nolan for the brilliant direction and writing . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0190332	what a major let down ! <sssss> i waited ages for to see this expecting a spectacular masterpiece that had me spellbound but what i got was a slow movie that left me empty and let down . <sssss> the special affects were good but if you are not a martial arts fan then they leave you cold . <sssss> who cares if the people can run over buildings ? <sssss> i could if i had wire strapped to my back . <sssss> who cares if they can fight ? <sssss> what wanted was a story that that tugged at my emotions and left me stunned but this didnt come close . <sssss> also it was full of chinese proverbs that got irritating . <sssss> proverbs such as '' if the tiger is asleep the bear isnt hungry '' what is that all about ! <sssss> maybe its because i dont like martial arts films that i give this a bad review but i still think this was dull . <sssss> 4 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0104691	for some reason or another i just could not get into this film , i found it tepid and dull and not a lot happened until the last 15 minutes . <sssss> i get a little sick of daniel day lewis doing films that set out to make the english look b ***** ds -lrb- he should look at some of his own country 's history ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> this film was just a vehicle for lewis to run about waving his ladyboy hair around . <sssss> i would love to go into what the film was about but i have forgot already ! <sssss> dull , dull , dull . <sssss> 5 out of 10 .
