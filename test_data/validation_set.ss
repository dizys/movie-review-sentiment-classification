ur0116181/	\tt0430357	6	i 'm a huge fan of michael mann -lrb- i even liked the keep a lot -rrb- . <sssss> nobody , even martin scorsese , does lawmen and the lawless better . <sssss> thief , heat and collateral are all classics -lrb- heat is as good as the 1st 2 godfathers -rrb- . <sssss> cut to the chase . <sssss> miami vice is a disappointment . <sssss> i 'm glad it diverged from the -lrb- excellent -rrb- tv show . <sssss> as a feature film it is flat and not involving . <sssss> colin farrell can not hold the screen as a leading man . <sssss> jamie foxx is handcuffed in a thankless role . <sssss> the villains are dull . <sssss> the action set pieces are few and seem like limp ripoffs of his other films . <sssss> there is no synergy here . <sssss> michael mann is all synergy . <sssss> the music is uninspired . <sssss> the editing is as confusing as the plot . <sssss> dion beebe 's groundbreaking high def work in collateral does n't work very well for this film . <sssss> there is not a single memorable moment in this film and coming from mann that is a shock . <sssss> i 'm rating this film against mann 's other films because i ca n't do so otherwise -lrb- like spielberg , cameron , howard , nolan , greengrass , eastwood and any other a-lister -rrb- . <sssss> so why do i give it a 6/10 ?
ur0116181/	\tt0141941	10	this film is unavoidably being compared to director alan j. pakula 's `` all the president 's men '' and for good reason , because michael mann 's new film is every bit as good . <sssss> -lrb- anybody is the tv news biz - like me - knows that newspaper and tv news are very different animals . <sssss> -rrb- `` the insider '' is a very mature film . <sssss> it takes its sweet time letting the events unfold . <sssss> however mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable . <sssss> but first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances : one by a master we 've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league . <sssss> of course i 'm talking about al pacino and russell crowe . <sssss> pacino adds another mammoth blast in his hall of fame collection of home run performances . <sssss> his portrayal of 60 minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting . <sssss> he vents anger and frustration better than any actor i 've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here . <sssss> now on to the `` new '' guy . <sssss> anybody who has seen russell crowe before -lrb- especially in his oscar-worthy effort in `` l.a. confidential '' -rrb- is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against pacino , but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this . <sssss> crowe 's role as `` the guy '' who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding . <sssss> not since pacino 's work in `` the godfather ii '' have i 've seen it done so well . <sssss> like every other thing mann has done the supporting actors are great too , but the standout here is christopher plummer 's mike wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line . <sssss> the story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff , but mann and co-scripter eric roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting . <sssss> it is riveting and important entertainment . <sssss> like the phrase `` tv journalism '' , `` important entertainment '' may seem like a contradiction of terms , but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year .
ur0550732/	\tt0829459	9	we start all of our reviews with the following information . <sssss> my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . <sssss> recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! <sssss> so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . <sssss> the point of this is that critics count for zero . <sssss> your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . <sssss> the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! <sssss> we never ever listen or read the critics . <sssss> we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . <sssss> well enough about that . <sssss> angelina jolie and dan futterman and the entire cast take us through what happened in the search for danny pearl that we did not see or hear about in the press as they frantically tried to find him before he was so brutally killed . <sssss> a very poignant love story with a horrific ending . <sssss> kudos to marianne pearl and angelina jolie and brad pitt who produced the movie .
ur0550732/	\tt0964517	10	my wife and i see over 100 movies a year , having been in the business and now retired . <sssss> we do not read any reviews by anyone . <sssss> we try to tell our friends that a critic is one person , he or she is not us . <sssss> critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear . <sssss> therefore , our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre . <sssss> many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction . <sssss> how can you review a movie without the real deal ? <sssss> a great movie with all three stars giving academy award performances amy adams , mark wahlberg and christian bale . <sssss> one of the best fight films we have ever seen . <sssss> amy adams does her usual fabulous job in still another type of roll . <sssss> wahlberg has become a terrific actor and director and christan bale steals the movie with his great acting . <sssss> do n't miss it .
ur0550732/	\tt0266543	10	we see over 75 movies a year and have not rated one a perfect 10 for over 3 years . <sssss> this is the perfect movie . <sssss> pixar is amazing . <sssss> everything about this movie from the storyline to the characters to the unbelievable graphics are spectacular . <sssss> hats off to pixar may they strike a new deal with disney and keep them coming . <sssss> never expected them to top toy story , then toy story ii and now this is even better . <sssss> wow !
ur0550732/	\tt0183649	8	we absolutely think that colin is simply a terrible , disgusting person and his language when interviewed is just not appropriate and he always looks dirty , but , he is simply fantastic in this movie . <sssss> academy award nomination is certainly possible . <sssss> we loved everything about this movie , very exciting and he is the entire movie . <sssss> then we found out that it was made in 10 days at a cost of only $ 1 million . <sssss> . <sssss> it shows that it can still be done ... a good movie at little or know cost . <sssss> no special effects , no big stars with $ 20 million salary . <sssss> simply wonderful . <sssss> hopefully he will grow up and become a human . <sssss> do n't miss it .
ur0365713/	\tt0165854	6	watching this film i feel like apologising to our american friends across the water for one of the worst acting performances i have seen by a british actor for a very long time . <sssss> let me explain that i am from london and i dont think i have ever met a person who speaks in the accent that terence stamp chose to in the limey . <sssss> his attempt at being a wide boy cockney is so bad that it spoilt what is not a bad film . <sssss> the story is simple and easy to follow and the film flows throughout ... . <sssss> until stamp opens his mouth . <sssss> the other actors such as luiz guzman and peter fonda do there best to pick up the pieces of stamps awful performance but it never recovers . <sssss> watch this for the worst cockney since dick van dyke ! <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0140352	8	russell crowe is fast gaining a great reputation as one of the top hollywood actors and his performance in the insider does nothing to this . <sssss> al pacino stars as a producer on cbs 's 60 minutes who tries to get a top executive who has just been fired from a tobbaco company to come clean on their dirty tricks which get the public hooked on the in tobbaco . <sssss> pacino , for the first time , comes up against his own bosses who are frightened about losing billions through litigation from the tobbaco company . <sssss> this film is 2 and a half hours long and not for one minute did i get bored , it is totaly and more than anything it is an insight into what can and has gone on in the news reporting the cover of the dvd it says `` the insider will thrill you with its unbelivable twists and turns '' . <sssss> i 'm not sure what they are talking about there because this is hardly the sixth sense but the insider is still a great movie . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0245674	7	i was expecting the usual teen slasher type horror with 13 ghost and a lot of this film is reminiscent of many horror movies but it also has that little bit extra that makes it above average . <sssss> the story is nothing special as is the acting but the concept of the mechanical house haunted by 13 ghosts that all are horrific in their own different way is very good and it does remind me very much of hellraiser . <sssss> the ending is poor as is the begining but what we see in the middle of the film is good and is even scary at times . <sssss> i would recommend this to most horror fans and even non horror fans . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0118636	6	apt pupil had the potential to be a great movie . <sssss> a script by stephen king and actors such as ian mckellen should have been a great recipe for a great film but i 'm afraid it was not . <sssss> dont get me wrong , apt pupil is ok , but thats as far as goes . <sssss> the film starts well then dies off for an hour and picks up again at the end , which is a big let down . <sssss> mckellen is good as usual but its hard to be brilliant when the story is a big anti climax . <sssss> i havent read the actual book by stephen king but i would be interested to see how true it is to the story as stephen king didnt actually write the screen play . <sssss> i also feel they should have had flash backs to the time the old man was a nazi to give it a little be of realism . <sssss> 6 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0098084	6	i found it really hard to come up with a mark out of 10 for pat sematary because there arent many bad things you can say about it yet there are many good things you can say . <sssss> with stephen kings screenplays there are either brilliant -lrb- green mile , misery -rrb- or they are apalling -lrb- quicksilver highway , sleepwalker -rrb- . <sssss> this is not in either bracket . <sssss> i have read the book and it the film is fairly true to it . <sssss> pet sematary is scary and does keep you on the edge of the seat but it is also fairy predictable . <sssss> the acting is ok and the special affects are alright too but nothing to get too excited about . <sssss> one question that i have to ask of the story is , why did the couple buy the house so near to a busy road when they have two young kids ? <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0122143	7	at the start of this film the first thing we see is caption that says '' none of the people seen are actors '' and although this statement does make you think that the last broadcast is maybe a real documentary , in the end you feel let down because this statement is a blatant lie only said for affect . <sssss> this is the story of a group 4 men who go into the woods to look for a demon as part of their cable show '' fact or fiction '' . <sssss> while there 3 of them are butchered leaving one survivor who is convicted of their murder . <sssss> we see the film as a documentary which shows clips of the video film that the men made just before and during their deaths . <sssss> i must say , i was fooled into thinking this was genuine which only fueled my dissapointment with the ending , which without giving away the plot , is a let down . <sssss> this is simular to blair witch but also inferior . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0068646	8	there is not a lot that can be said about the godfather that has not already been said so i wont bother to give a description of what this masterpiece is about but i will mention a few thing about the acting . <sssss> it is the acting in the godfather that makes this film stand out not really the storyline . <sssss> we see such actors as marlon brando , james caan and robert duvall pull off some of their best performances of their careers but the final word must be left for al pacino . <sssss> this is as far as i know pacino 's first real leading role and does n't he grab the part by the horns ! <sssss> a classic film that has not dated at all . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0128278	8	anthony hopkins and cuba gooding jnr star in a brilliant psychological thriller about an apparent violent anthropologist who is examined by an up an coming psychiatrist who ends up befriending and trying to understand why he killed two men . <sssss> this film is brilliantly acted by both leading men and has you gripped from the first minute . <sssss> the scenes with the gorillas are fascinating and shot , although at times a little upsetting . <sssss> this film is a little bit like silence of the lambs in the respect of anthony hopkins character but that 's not a critisism as i think 99 % of people would enjoy this movie .
ur0365713/	\tt0241303	9	having watched chocolat i so wanted to have a rant at how this film is about the fight against the bile and hatred that is religion but if i did this would distract from what is a very good film that deserves better comments than my anti religious rantings . <sssss> juliette binoche lights up this delightful film as does all the cast and it is unusual to have a film that has johnny depp in it and not have too much to say about his role . <sssss> not that it 's bad , it good ` but all the characters are so interesting and well acted he is overshadowed a little . <sssss> i would recommend this movie to anyone , it appeals to all and although two hours long , it flies by . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0120601	6	if you have n't seen being john malkovich and you are under the impression that this film is going to be completly weird you might be a little dissapointed when you watch this . <sssss> ok it is strange but in a silly way not in an arty way which is sad . <sssss> why john malkovich agreed to star in this or even let the film go ahead is a mystery to me . <sssss> now if the film was called '' being bradd pitt '' or `` being madonna '' in other words more interesting people this might have been better . <sssss> there are some good parts of the film , the first half hour for instance when he first goes to his place of work , the seventh and half floor , it has you gripped and is funny in part but , like the portal in craig 's office it goes down hill from there . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur2444068/	\tt0102768	8	henry -lrb- harrison ford -rrb- is a terrific but dastardly lawyer . <sssss> defending a hospital for negligence against a poverty-stricken diabetic , henry wins ! <sssss> its not the first time the little folks have gotten the shaft from henry . <sssss> he lives in a posh new york city apartment with his beautiful wife -lrb- annette bening -rrb- and sweet daughter . <sssss> yet , things are strained on the home front between the couple and money goes through their hands like water . <sssss> however , one evening when henry slips out to buy cigarettes at the shop around the corner , he is caught in a holdup and ends up getting shot . <sssss> there is considerable brain damage and the doctors can not tell henry 's wife just what his future holds . <sssss> thus begins a lengthy rehabilitation for the lawyer that includes learning to speak and write all over again . <sssss> he makes great strides with the help of a very caring therapist . <sssss> most importantly , henry changes from a person with a very dark demeanor to one who is almost innocent in his view of the world . <sssss> still , many secrets remain , mostly from henry 's past life at the law firm . <sssss> can henry and his wife overcome their problems and stay together ? <sssss> this is a very nice movie with plenty of heartwarming scenes . <sssss> ford has never been better than he is here , for his role runs the gamut from despicable lawyer to a disabled man struggling to speak and relearn basic skills . <sssss> bening is also great as the wife who finds a way to fall in love with her husband all over again . <sssss> the rest of the cast is also quite nice , especially the gentleman who plays henry 's therapist . <sssss> then , too , the sets , costumes , direction and production are very worthy . <sssss> still , the movie 's themes are the most important aspects of the film , as the film questions the integrity of the law profession and also ponders whether the best part of a person is his heart or his brain . <sssss> regarding all of the films , sitting on the shelves of a video store , this one is something special . <sssss> do n't delay in garnering a view for you and your partner soon .
ur2444068/	\tt0097737	3	steven -lrb- peter weller -rrb- is one of the employees of an underwater mining firm . <sssss> their headquarters is down deep in the ocean and the bosses are pretty interested in profits alone . <sssss> one fateful day , as they say , the scuba diving crew stumbles across a sunken soviet ship . <sssss> during the investigation of the vessel , one of the divers almost dies when his equipment malfunctions . <sssss> our hero steven saves him . <sssss> but , soon after the workers leave the ussr boat , some begin to have strange symptoms . <sssss> a lady is so overcome with pain and itching that she commits suicide . <sssss> another has a fever and so on . <sssss> the firm 's on-site physician , doc -lrb- richard crenna -rrb- detects that the dna of one of afflicted patients is `` changing '' . <sssss> sure enough , soon an alien-type monster takes over his body and the whole company is fighting for their lives , as more folks experience the same `` thing '' , haha . <sssss> can steven figure out how to rescue the remaining employees and , hopefully , kill the lethal leviathan ? <sssss> as happens so often , hollywood scores a hit , like alien or the abyss , and gets the idea that more of the same is what viewers want . <sssss> unfortunately , this film presents nothing new or exciting to the original works . <sssss> it is basically james cameron and , therefore , is very disappointing . <sssss> even the last line is a direct rip-off of the final exclamation from the terminator flick ! <sssss> its only redeeming quality is the fine cast . <sssss> weller is one handsome lad and makes a great hero . <sssss> crenna , amanda pays , ernie hudson , and all of the others do their best and deserve so much better . <sssss> all right , the underwater shots are fairly nice , too . <sssss> if you love cinematic science fiction , in a `` let 's make fun of it '' way , a la mystery science theater , you might look for this one at the usual outlets . <sssss> otherwise , any view will make you feel as bad as one of the monster 's victims .
ur2444068/	\tt1046163	3	tank -lrb- dane cook -rrb- has a job as a `` '' for a company that sells air purifiers . <sssss> what this means , basically , is that he tells folks in 1,001 ways that they are not getting their hard-earned money returned to them , even if their devices do n't work . <sssss> in addition to this sleazebag job , he has an unsavory moonlighting position , too . <sssss> he will , for a fee , take a man 's ex-girlfriend out on a miserable date or two , so that the female will come running back to her former flame . <sssss> she will do this because her old mate will look `` good '' to her and because she will be scared of the quality of single , available men out in the big world . <sssss> it works stingingly well . <sssss> but , one day , tank is asked to date the gal his roommate , dustin -lrb- jason biggs -rrb- had fallen in love with and been dumped by . <sssss> tank is hesitant since dustin is a personal friend but eventually he agrees to meet alexis -lrb- kate hudson -rrb- . <sssss> but , lo and behold , alexis is different from a lot of other females . <sssss> not only is she gorgeous and smart , she does n't seem to mind it when tank plays his car stereo at full volume or takes her to a strip club for their first date . <sssss> this may take more than one encounter , thus providing time for tank to begin to admire his prey . <sssss> is there a possible love triangle in the future ? <sssss> this film has some genuine intelligence and humor , but no one will notice . <sssss> it is , quite frankly , a sleazy , dirty , offensive film that will send most fans of romantic comedy running to the box office for a refund . <sssss> there is an abundance of bad language , gross humor , and sexual scenarios that make the film a strong `` r '' , putting it a category of for the average film goer . <sssss> that said , the cast is an asset , with cook doing a fine down-and-dirty turn as the amoral opportunist , and hudson , biggs , and alec baldwin providing nice support as the other major players . <sssss> the production values are also above average , with nice costumes , metropolitan sets , camera work and direction . <sssss> but , the script is replete with thoughts and ideas that register disgust , not admiration . <sssss> if you are a huge fan of light romance , do not see this movie , you will be absolutely horrified . <sssss> unless you are `` up for anything '' , this is a flick you would not wish on your best friend 's girl , mother , dog , et cetera .
ur2444068/	\tt1152836	8	john dillinger -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- is very adept at robbing banks in the 1930 's . <sssss> he and his closest friends have done well , so well that they have a definite swagger in their steps . <sssss> and , since they have executed successful jailbreaks a time or two , their skills are formidable . <sssss> naturally , this is most upsetting to the young director of the fbi , j.edgar hoover -lrb- billy crudup -rrb- , compounded by the fact that there are no laws to cover the crossing of state lines during a crime spree . <sssss> but , will press on . <sssss> enlisting the services of one very determined g-man , melvin purvis -lrb- christian bale -rrb- , hoover assembles his gang of `` go-to '' guys . <sssss> in the meanwhile , john has spotted a beautiful but poor gal in chicago , billie -lrb- marion cotillard -rrb- and insists that she become his woman . <sssss> bowing to his looks , wealth , and charm , she accepts his advances and the couple enjoys a brief interlude of romance . <sssss> but , money does run out and john & co. have to plan their next heists . <sssss> they even join forces with babyface nelson for awhile . <sssss> can the `` public enemy '' criminals escape the hand of the law forever ? <sssss> this is a very worthwhile film , especially for those who love action , gun battles and history . <sssss> the casting of depp as dillinger is terrific , making it difficult to see anyone else in this role . <sssss> but , bale , cotillard , crudup , leelee sobieski , and all of the others are quite fine , too . <sssss> then , too , the re-creation of the depression era deserves much praise , for the sets , costumes , camera work , script , dialogue and direction all work well to fashion this bygone time in american history . <sssss> one small comment to add is that it is pretty violent , so if you do n't like a bit of blood and guts , stay away . <sssss> but , then , its not excessively gory , either . <sssss> therefore , while it may not be the best film of 2009 , it is hard to imagine anyone not being enthralled public enemies .
ur2444068/	\tt0962736	8	princess victoria -lrb- emily blunt -rrb- is in line for the throne of england . <sssss> the present king william -lrb- jim broadbent -rrb- is not well and may not live long . <sssss> however , vicky 's scheming mother , the duchess of kent -lrb- miranda -rrb- and her aide , john -lrb- mark strong -rrb- want to force victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the `` regents '' until she is older , since she is only 20 years of age . <sssss> the young lady refuses , despite john slapping her around . <sssss> it is another sign that victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country . <sssss> yet , when william does pass away , shortly after her 21st birthday , victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her . <sssss> first , she must surround herself with the `` right '' advisers to govern wisely . <sssss> she chooses handsome lord melbourne -lrb- paul bettany -rrb- who , although an older man , is mentioned as a suitor for vicky . <sssss> which brings us to the young queen 's second major decision . <sssss> sooner than not , the young queen should select her future mate , as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom , for an heir must appear in the coming years . <sssss> meanwhile , in germany , some distant relatives of the british royal family are hatching some plans as well . <sssss> handsome prince albert -lrb- rupert friend -rrb- , of the dynasty , is prodded by his father to court the young english royal . <sssss> once he arrives at the palace , he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual . <sssss> but , since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making , can he succeed in winning her heart ? <sssss> this is a lovely film , made even better by a completely winning performance by emily blunt as victoria . <sssss> yes , she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily . <sssss> friend , too , does well , as do the other actors , including broadbent , richardson , bettany , strong -lrb- what a repulsive role ! <sssss> -rrb- , and the rest . <sssss> also , the movie is gorgeously shot , costumed , and set , making it a visual treat in every way . <sssss> if anything is lacking , it is an extra dose of dazzle , as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic , at times , with a somewhat unimaginative edit . <sssss> however , this is only a minor , minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film . <sssss> in short , young and old , should make time for young victoria . <sssss> it is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings .
