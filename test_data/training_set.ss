ur0116181/	\tt0185937	1	sometimes popular opinion really sucks about a film elevating a rotten movie to cult status and if you do n't like it then you obviously do n't get it . <sssss> this movie is one of them . <sssss> the much discussed camera moves did not make me sick , but the whiny idiotic characters did . <sssss> the suspense was minimal . <sssss> i do n't care if it was really low budget . <sssss> i 'm not going to grade a film on degree of difficulty . <sssss> i 'm sure that `` titanic '' was a very tough experience for the production crew . <sssss> i do n't care ! <sssss> it was a great movie because it had a great story and great characters and was really well put together . <sssss> this movie did n't have any of those things . <sssss> it telegraphed the last shot in the first 15 minutes . <sssss> this is one of those rare films that made me angry that i wasted my time with it .
ur0116181/	\tt0169547	10	this is an amazing piece of work and it probably tops `` the insider '' , `` the sixth sense '' , `` edtv '' and `` bringing out the dead '' as my favorite film of the year . <sssss> alan ball 's screenplay is one the modern wonders of the world and sam mendes 's direction matches it -lrb- i can see why he bested michael mann as the l.a. film critics director of the year -rrb- . <sssss> where did these guys come from ? <sssss> this story of an american family and the tiny slice of the world they live in is unspooled before us with the precision and fascination of a geneticist unravelling a strand of dna through an electron microscope . <sssss> this is not to suggest that the film is cold -lrb- far from it -rrb- . <sssss> it just felt like i was watching the characters lives from beneath their skins . <sssss> rarely have i felt like i knew an entire cast so well . <sssss> this will be a hard movie to reward at oscar time because every single performance hit exactly the right key -lrb- `` l.a. confidential '' had the same problem -rrb- , but obviously kevin spacey and annette benning should lead actor noms . <sssss> spacey has played laconic many times before -lrb- i ca n't think of a film where he has n't been this way before -rrb- , but not with the dry wit and comic timing he displays here . <sssss> even when he blows up it is dry . <sssss> benning has her best role since `` the grifters '' and makes the most it . <sssss> she is a stepford wife with real ambition . <sssss> they are a married couple who long ago gave up on the american dream but are too comfortable to give up the amercian facade and this is ball 's key contempt . <sssss> it is a very unique view . <sssss> while the adults know that they are screwed up the kids still fight to have hope . <sssss> it is their rebellion . <sssss> thora burch is outstanding as the lone child of spacey and benning who is getting killed by her parents ' cynicism . <sssss> the most frightening performance is given by wes bentley as the next door neighbor kid who is constantly peeping and taping other people 's lives , but also finding beauty amid the ugliness and chaos in some of the film 's most moving scenes -lrb- a lot people will not get the significance and meaning of the paper bag , but those who do understand the film completely -- i thought is was awesome -rrb- . <sssss> i think he is acting as the filmakers . <sssss> finally mena suvari is a revelation as the smart-ass and all-knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability . <sssss> this film is very dark but like `` bringing out the dead '' there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end . <sssss> i was floored by this . <sssss> it is also a very funny film . <sssss> american beauty may be the best film of a very good year .
ur0116181/	\tt0478304	5	this movie does not belong in a cinema . <sssss> it belongs in a museum of modern art running in a continuous loop . <sssss> -lrb- at least `` melancholia '' has a plot . <sssss> -rrb- terrence malick 's ruminations on the difficulty of balancing nature & grace is beautiful bore . <sssss> there are images in this film that are as breathtaking as any i 've ever seen in cinema . <sssss> the 19 minute sequence that depicts `` creation '' is easily worthy of favorable comparison to `` 2001 '' 's `` voyage beyond infinity '' sequence . <sssss> i was practically floating out of my chair while watching -- experiencing -- it . <sssss> it also features a couple of brief dinosaur scenes which surpass any in `` jurassic park '' in terms of sheer realization & beauty . <sssss> this portion of the film was definitely worth the effort put into creating it . <sssss> but there are 2 other hours of this film which occasionally stir emotions & do n't really connect to anything except malick 's own cosmic navel gazing . <sssss> i love `` 2001 '' , `` walkabout ' , `` '' & `` brazil '' . <sssss> `` the tree of life '' shares these films uniqueness & sense of wonder but did n't connect with me on a deeper level like them . <sssss> call me a low brow , but i 'll take `` caption america : the first avenger '' over this film any day .
ur0116181/	\tt0195685	10	the first nominees for next year 's oscars in the best picture , best actress , best supporting actor , best director , best original or adapted screenplay and best costume design categories have already been secured with the arrival of `` erin brockovich '' . <sssss> julia roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in u.s. history . <sssss> she would 've stole every scene if it was n't for her co-star albert finney who matches her for every . <sssss> he plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight . <sssss> although her box office says otherwise i 've always thought roberts was way overrated as a movie star . <sssss> now i 'm a believer . <sssss> she is smart , sassy , foul-mouthed , fiery , sensitive , funny and , of course , very sexy . <sssss> it is one of best performances i 've ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of susan sarandon 's annie savoy from `` bull durham '' in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal . <sssss> -lrb- of course annie savoy is purely fictional whereas erin brockovich is not . <sssss> -rrb- i sense that her character may appeal more to men than women -lrb- her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film -rrb- . <sssss> the reviews i 've read have been excellent , but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well . <sssss> finney 's work is more nuanced than roberts ' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions . <sssss> aaron eckhardt deserves mention too as roberts ' good guy biker boyfriend . <sssss> these performances are made possible by a superb script from susannah grant . <sssss> her fact-based tale of a small -lrb- hick -rrb- town poisoned by a giant utility has `` rocky '' - like satisfactions in it and they feel all earned . <sssss> the fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings . <sssss> director steven soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated `` out of sight '' . <sssss> this is an `` adult '' movie in the very best sense of that term . <sssss> `` erin brockovich '' is definitely a big hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it . <sssss> it also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly . <sssss> it is the first best picture nominee for next year .
ur0116181/	\tt0217869	10	my expectations for writer/director m. night shyamalan 's next movie after `` the sixth sense '' were extremely high and `` unbreakable '' did not let me down . <sssss> in fact , in some respects , it is a better and more self assured movie than the former . <sssss> like `` 6th '' , `` un '' is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na give anything away here . <sssss> however i will say that bruce willis and samuel l. jackson -lrb- has this guy ever given a bad performance ? <sssss> -rrb- are outstanding as the leads . <sssss> there is not a wasted role in the movie . <sssss> shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality . <sssss> the spirit of rod serling lives in him . <sssss> his direction and writing are a synergistic blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions . <sssss> he is aided greatly by james newton howard 's brilliant score and eduardo serra 's daring cinematography . <sssss> this movie takes more chances than `` 6th '' . <sssss> you either buy it or you do n't . <sssss> it has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust . <sssss> `` un '' does n't benefit from `` 6th '' 's shock value , but i think is a more accomplished piece overall . <sssss> it and `` erin brokovich are clearly this year 's 2 best movies .
ur0116181/	\tt0181689	10	let me warn you that a.i. was my favorite film last year . <sssss> it is still early but this film could very well find itself as my pick for best film of 2002 . <sssss> a.i. is deeply felt . <sssss> minority report is deeply thought . <sssss> it has a better plot than the classic bladerunner and the look is just as spectacular . <sssss> i wo n't say that is a better film than bladerunner -lrb- yet -rrb- . <sssss> spielberg has done it again by bringing some very hard edges to his style . <sssss> the world 's all-time best director has left warm and fuzzy far behind . <sssss> his screenwriters have done a great job at staying true to phillip k. dick 's mind-bending prose . <sssss> this a plot driven movie with some very cool performances especially in the supporting -lrb- and cameo -rrb- roles . <sssss> tom cruise is fine as the hunter turned hunted . <sssss> however samantha morton had the most difficult job to pull off as a future telling savant and she definitely should be remembered at oscar time . <sssss> steven spielberg has rocketed into adulthood since schindler 's list . <sssss> i still love , e.t. and raiders , but minority joins , ryan and a.i. as very daring cinema that refuses a safety net . <sssss> the gadgets and the the eye-candy are less obvious than a.i. but every bit as fantastic . <sssss> this is a great detective story brilliantly told 52 years from now . <sssss> if you like phillip k. dick and spielberg rush out to see this movie , but bring your brain . <sssss> i 'm in awe .
ur0116181/	\tt0062622	10	this was the movie that made me fall in love with movies -- needless to say it also my all-time favorite . <sssss> 2001 is a movie that demands that you watch it and not listen to it . <sssss> it refuses to spell out what is going on although it has a perfectly coherent plot . <sssss> its ending is debatable only to those who ca n't make up their minds -lrb- i think it is all about man 's transcendence -- as opposed to evolution -- into the next level of existence -rrb- . <sssss> it is a film for -- i.e. non-verbal , non-linear -- thinkers . <sssss> 2001 is more than 30 years old and like all classic films has the freshness of today 's latest release . <sssss> even the f/x have held up over time . <sssss> i think the `` voyage beyond infinity '' sequence ranks as one of the top 5 f/x sequences ever . <sssss> i was 14 years old when i first saw it -lrb- about 5 years after it was first released -rrb- and i do n't think i 've ever fully returned from it . <sssss> -lrb- this movie was the most powerful `` say no to drugs '' statement ever made to me . <sssss> -rrb- there have only been a handful of films over years that can be classified as `` pure cinema '' and 2001 is the best of them .
ur0116181/	\tt0155267	9	i do n't want to jinx this movie , but this is this year 's out of sight -lrb- and i hope it makes the b.o. that out of sight deserved to make -rrb- . <sssss> it is one of the most stylish , smart and sexy movies i 've ever seen . <sssss> pierce brosnan 's role as crown unavoidably has some bondish trappings but this works as a plus rather than a minus . <sssss> brosnan is virtually perfect in the role . <sssss> denis leary has just the right edge as the cop whose job it is to catch him , but despite these two winning performances the movie belongs to rene russo . <sssss> for the last few years she has been one of the most enjoyable actresses to watch due to her ability to carry off toughness with a smile . <sssss> here she moves up several levels in her craft as she intertwines real sizzle with a steel will . <sssss> i hope oscar does not overlook her work in this one because she is an early and deserving contender for lead actress . <sssss> and what about john mctiernan ? <sssss> this guy directed die hard , predator -lrb- which was much better than it had any right to be -rrb- and the hunt for red october then slipped almost totally from memory . <sssss> now with this one he is back on the a-list with a bullet -lrb- something this movie refreshingly lacks by the way -rrb- . <sssss> this movie soars on charm , plotting and style . <sssss> it knows exactly when to cut from one scene to another . <sssss> it never drags and it looks great . <sssss> i 'm too young to remember the original movie so this was all new material to me . <sssss> i 'm sure if you look very closely at it the plot comes apart , but i do n't care to because i was enjoying the ride too much . <sssss> obviously i was taken by complete surprise by this movie . <sssss> congratulations to all involved with the making of this movie . <sssss> i 'll be talking it up at work tomorrow .
ur0116181/	\tt0140352	10	this film is unavoidably being compared to director alan j. pakula 's `` all the president 's men '' and for good reason , because michael mann 's new film is every bit as good . <sssss> -lrb- anybody is the tv news biz - like me - knows that newspaper and tv news are very different animals . <sssss> -rrb- `` the insider '' is a very mature film . <sssss> it takes its sweet time letting the events unfold . <sssss> however mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable . <sssss> but first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances : one by a master we 've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league . <sssss> of course i 'm talking about al pacino and russell crowe . <sssss> pacino adds another mammoth blast in his hall of fame collection of home run performances . <sssss> his portrayal of 60 minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting . <sssss> he vents anger and frustration better than any actor i 've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here . <sssss> now on to the `` new '' guy . <sssss> anybody who has seen russell crowe before -lrb- especially in his oscar-worthy effort in `` l.a. confidential '' -rrb- is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against pacino , but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this . <sssss> crowe 's role as `` the guy '' who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding . <sssss> not since pacino 's work in `` the godfather ii '' have i 've seen it done so well . <sssss> like every other thing mann has done the supporting actors are great too , but the standout here is christopher plummer 's mike wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line . <sssss> the story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff , but mann and co-scripter eric roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting . <sssss> it is riveting and important entertainment . <sssss> like the phrase `` tv journalism '' , `` important entertainment '' may seem like a contradiction of terms , but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year .
ur0116181/	\tt0887912	10	without a doubt this is the best war film since saving private ryan -lrb- & i loved black hawk down & flags of our fathers -rrb- . <sssss> it is intense & continuously involving . <sssss> this is bigelow 's best film since -lrb- the classic -rrb- near dark . <sssss> if the subject , army bomb squad in iraq , does n't intrigue you then you probably think that `` shakespeare in love '' really did deserve it best picture oscar . <sssss> the acting is excellent throughout but there is a star making performance by jeremy renner that will leave you stunned . <sssss> it was smart to cast this film with mostly actors that you do n't recognize . <sssss> the movie has a documentary feel to it which adds greatly to the tension in it . <sssss> dp barry ackroyd also shot the unnerving united 93 . <sssss> the editing is virtually perfect . <sssss> you know exactly where you are at in the rubble strewn streets where life fights like weeds in cracked concrete to take hold -lrb- again -rrb- . <sssss> and the shots never linger too long -lrb- or too short -rrb- . <sssss> bigelow has always given us beautifully stylized scenes , but except for one very effective slo-mo shot she seems to have sacrificed that trait for the story -lrb- or shooting schedule -rrb- . <sssss> it does n't look like `` a kathryn bigelow film '' . <sssss> but few films rise above their script . <sssss> mark boal 's screenplay is a lesson on how to tell a great story with a minimum of exposition . <sssss> the characters are defined almost entirely by their actions . <sssss> i hope the oscars reward this movie well . <sssss> i drove 112 miles to sherman oaks to see it & it was worth it . <sssss> i ca n't wait to see it again . <sssss> update january 2010 : this film is even better on a 2nd viewing . <sssss> it is just as intense -lrb- amazingly -rrb- . <sssss> i noticed much more character development this time around . <sssss> the acting & script retain their original luster i was wrong about it not really looking like `` a bigelow film '' because it does . <sssss> there is no other film-maker that sees things quite like she does . <sssss> if you missed in the cinemas do n't fret ; it plays just as well on a decent home screen -lrb- my 32 '' flat screen was just fine -rrb- .
ur0116181/	\tt0372784	10	having seen this film a 2nd time only confirms my initial take on it . <sssss> this is an angry , ferocious , intelligent and thoroughly adult batman . <sssss> however it is a warmer film the 2nd time around . <sssss> when nolan was announced as the director to resurrect the bat a couple of years ago i was thrilled . <sssss> i knew he would n't screw it up . <sssss> let 's face it the excellent memento and insomnia were n't exactly laugh riots . <sssss> the thoughtfulness that made those films what they are make batman begins what it is . <sssss> before we declare it the best film based on comic book character or story we must remember the crow . <sssss> bale is perfect as bruce wayne/batman . <sssss> he is brooding , tortured and deadly serious , but -lrb- like brandon lee as eric crow -rrb- there is a real soulfulness in his work . <sssss> he and russell crowe -lrb- from the greatly under-appreciated cinderella man -- the other great film of ' 05 -rrb- dominate but never steal , the screen when they are on it . <sssss> also i loved michael caine , liam neeson , gary oldham -lrb- refreshingly playing a good guy -rrb- and morgan freeman . <sssss> there is not a single sour note in any work here and , yes , i think tom wilkinson as falcone does a fine job . <sssss> this is a film for the mind and the eye . <sssss> like cinderella man the riches here are very abundant . <sssss> when i was 1st blown away by frank miller 's revisionist batman in `` the dark knight returns '' -lrb- and it unfairly maligned sequel -rrb- , batman begins was how i hoped batman would be translated to the big screen . <sssss> batman returns came close -lrb- thanks to keaton , pfieffer and devito -rrb- , but this bat even blows that one away . <sssss> this film has as much frank miller in it -lrb- along with some alan moore -rrb- as miller 's own sin city . <sssss> batman begins is astonishing . <sssss> note to christopher nolan and david goyer : if you can pull off an r-rating i loved to see `` the killing joke '' .
ur0116181/	\tt1285016	10	like others before me when i initially heard about this project i wondered what could a director as talented as david fincher see in a facebook movie ? <sssss> -lrb- i thought this was just a project to keep him busy before his take on `` the girl with the dragon tattoo '' . <sssss> -rrb- what finch & writer aaron sorkin saw was an epic tale about human triumph & tragedy set in the digital age & pretty much encompassed in one man 's soul . <sssss> and now we see one of the very best films of the year . <sssss> i rank it along with `` se7en '' & `` the curious case of benjamin button '' as one of fincher 's best films . <sssss> jesse eisenberg is spectacular as fb founder mark zuckerberg in the most complex performance of the year . <sssss> he is an unsympathetic underdog & yet i found myself siding with him . <sssss> he is not an anti-hero . <sssss> i often root for anti-heroes . <sssss> this guy is something different altogether . <sssss> know what ? <sssss> there is no small amount of lisbeth salander in him or his portrayal here . <sssss> but other actors shine here too : andrew garfield & justin timberlake -lrb- yeah , that timberlake -rrb- hit it out of the park as the burned partner & the . <sssss> sorkin 's script is a marvel of fast-paced dialog & is funny as hell . <sssss> i never thought i 'd be laughing as much as i did here . <sssss> this is , by far , fincher 's funniest film . <sssss> jeff cronenweth 's cinematography carries on his father 's legacy proudly . <sssss> the score by trent reznor & co. is the most inventive since hans zimmer 's & james newton howard 's `` the dark knight '' .
ur0116181/	\tt0167404	10	the word of mouth -lrb- wom -rrb- on this movie has been huge and i finally got around to seeing it after 4 weeks and i 'm glad i did . <sssss> if you have not seen it yet do not know the ending . <sssss> i wo n't even hint at it here except to say it is one the best in movie history . <sssss> this is easily one of the best 3 films of year -lrb- among the matrix , edtv and thomas crown -rrb- . <sssss> i had tears running down my cheeks about 4 different times throughout this film and all because i cared about the kid . <sssss> haley joe osment gives the best child performance i 've ever seen -lrb- even topping those given in and et and sleepers -rrb- as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost . <sssss> he should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor oscar -lrb- but then again `` shakespeare ... '' won a `` best film '' oscar last year -rrb- . <sssss> bruce willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid -lrb- anybody who saw `` nobody 's fool '' will not be surprised by his work here -rrb- and toni collette -lrb- who ? <sssss> -rrb- is just right as the kid 's mom . <sssss> also olivia williams is very fine and very beautiful as willis 's wife . <sssss> writer-director m. night trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as `` titanic '' or `` field of dreams '' . <sssss> the scares here are creepy but not shocking . <sssss> he 's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie . <sssss> his direction is virtually perfect . <sssss> james newton howard 's score is his best since `` grand canyon '' and just as memorable -lrb- i ca n't wait to buy it -rrb- . <sssss> i 'd heard that it was an excellent movie , but i still was n't prepared by how good it was . <sssss> the thing that really sets it apart is that for a scary movie it is touches your heart and in that respect it reminds me of `` ghost '' -lrb- although this is much scarier -rrb- and `` jacob 's ladder '' .
ur0116181/	\tt1152836	7	maybe this movie suffers from comparisons with the hurt locker which i had seen 2 days earlier , but i found this highly anticipated movie static & unmoving . <sssss> how could you go wrong with putting down $ 7.50 seeing michael mann direct a period gangster piece with johnny depp & christian bale going toe to toe ? <sssss> -lrb- by unable to stop the constant urge to compare it to a non-stop intense movie about an army bomb squad in iraq ? <sssss> -rrb- because this movie like his last one , miami vice , never really gets going . <sssss> it has fine performances : depp as dillinger , cotillard as his dame & bale as g-man melvin purvis are all very good . <sssss> however my favorite performance was billy crudup who gives `` his '' j. edgar hoover a wicked effeminate flair . <sssss> -lrb- forgive me -- or not -- for not enjoying hoover played as bit of a . <sssss> -rrb- mann is not a grab you by the throat artist -lrb- like paul greengrass or , evidently , kathryn bigelow -rrb- . <sssss> his best films -lrb- thief , the insider , heat , collateral -rrb- seduce you . <sssss> this one does n't although it tries very hard . <sssss> like all mann movies , public enemies , is put together with a great deal of care , informed with great intelligence -lrb- that even permeated his pulp masterpiece collateral -rrb- & has atmosphere to burn . <sssss> it just does n't quite come together as anything more than occasionally involving . <sssss> also the digital photography ruined some shots -lrb- it worked in collateral , but it did n't work in ... vice & it does n't work here -rrb- . <sssss> mann has hit grand slams before , but this movie results in a ground rule double .
ur0116181/	\tt0257044	9	sam mendes 's directorial follow up to `` american beauty '' has oscar in its cross hairs and for good reason . <sssss> although not quite as provocative as involving as `` minority report '' , `` road to perdition '' lingers in your mind long after the lights go up . <sssss> tom hanks and paul newman are excellent as major crime figures in and around chicago in 1931 . <sssss> -lrb- i do n't want to give too much away here because there are some nice , albeit subtle , surprises in their relationship . <sssss> -rrb- both slightly underplay their roles relying more on quiet and studied gestures than anything loud and showy . <sssss> there is almost a foreign film to the shots and the way they hold the faces and what passes across them . <sssss> -lrb- conrad hall 's camerawork is crucial and gorgeous . <sssss> -rrb- newman is a national movie treasure . <sssss> he is a bit before `` my time '' , but i have come to marvel at his work in `` the verdict '' , `` the color of money '' , `` nobody 's fool '' and now this film . <sssss> hank 's work here recalls the inner , guarded and very private turmoil he conveyed in `` saving private ryan '' . <sssss> hanks play against his stereotype as a good guy as a very bad guy on a noble mission . <sssss> this should get him another oscar nomination . <sssss> newman is surprisingly threatening -lrb- a supporting actor nomination for him -rrb- . <sssss> both of them know where they are ending up in the very end . <sssss> jude law and stanley tucci should not be overlooked next february either . <sssss> mendes 's direction is so confident that you are in awe of his talent -lrb- much as you were while discovering `` american beauty '' -rrb- . <sssss> he exercises so much control over the material that it should be suffocating , but it is n't . <sssss> this is a quiet movie with a lot of muscle -lrb- so please get a babysitter for your tot and put your cell phone on silent mode -rrb- . <sssss> the violence is almost shocking but never out of context . <sssss> this is a very brutal world being portrayed on the screen . <sssss> it has more action than you might expect . <sssss> mendes spoke about subtext in a recent new york times magazine piece about him . <sssss> this film is loaded with it and is probably the reason i liked it so much . <sssss> this is an film that will be a real treat for demanding filmgoers .
ur0116181/	\tt0416449	8	this is n't the godfather or close encounters or united 93 , but it is what it is and that is -lrb- not that bill clinton would ever understand what `` is '' is -rrb- one helluva kickass sandal , sword and splatter pic that is fun to watch on a big screen . <sssss> whatever hollywood rocket scientist decided to leave director zack snyder alone to make his and his marvelous crews ' vision come to life got it right ! <sssss> the only stupid thing about 300 is the rock soundtrack which is mostly lost amid all the mayhem -lrb- thank you for mostly burying it , sound editors , mixers , whatever ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the actors deliver all their lines with gusto . <sssss> gerard butler is totally believable as king of the spartans -lrb- imagine if oliver stone had cast him as alexander ? <sssss> -rrb- and the women and children characters make strong impressions as well . <sssss> but let 's face it i went to see this film for its look . <sssss> it looks fantastic and feels it too . <sssss> -lrb- last year 's x-men 3 sent me out of the theatre with the same sort of good charged buzz although x3 is a better pic -rrb- . <sssss> the `` slow parts '' are entertaining . <sssss> gladiator died when russell crowe was n't on the screen . <sssss> 300 does n't die when butler is off the screen which he is n't very often . <sssss> the violence and gore is abundant but never gratuitous . <sssss> it is so stylized and over-the-top that i never winced once from watching it . <sssss> james cameron and paul verhoeven and tony scott stage such bloodletting similarly . <sssss> snyder knows how to thrill without sickening . <sssss> definitely not for kids . <sssss> if you bring a child into 300 then you are a sicko -lrb- go back and wallow in your saw and hostel and hills have eyes and get sterilized -- please do the human race a favor -rrb- ! <sssss> i ca n't say that i loved this pic , but , wow ! <sssss> , i like it lot and more than i liked the departed . <sssss> hey zack , will this mean they 'll greenlight watchmen ? <sssss> -lrb- be a bit more careful with the screenplay because you got chris nolan 's batman to live up to . <sssss> -rrb-
ur0116181/	\tt1568346	9	the novel & the swedish movie are not great by any standards -lrb- they are pretty damn good -rrb- , but the `` girl '' , lisbeth salander & noomi rapace as lisbeth are great . <sssss> i 'm not surprised that david fincher made a better movie than the original . <sssss> fincher is at the top of his game here . <sssss> `` the social network '' , `` the curious case of benjamin button '' & `` se7en '' are better movies because the source material is better . <sssss> the shock here is rooney mara as salander . <sssss> rapace was electric as salander in all 3 movies made from the millennium trilogy . <sssss> mara is slightly better . <sssss> in either incarnation you can not tear your eyes away from the screen when salander appears , but there something about mara 's work that runs a bit deeper than rapace 's & i 'll have to see this film again to get a better handle on that . <sssss> another shock is that this `` americanized '' version is a harder `` r '' than the euro version . <sssss> this ai n't a date movie . <sssss> of course daniel craig is perfect as blomkvist . <sssss> christopher plummer is perfect as vanger . <sssss> stellan -lrb- sic -rrb- briefly channels joe doe in a key scene . <sssss> steven zallian 's is more true to the novel despite a non-important tweak of the ending . <sssss> trent reznor & atticus ross 's music is mesmerizing meriting a 2nd oscar for them . <sssss> jeff cronenweth 's cinematography is worthy of the best of his late father 's work . <sssss> the opening title sequence is sick , twisted & brilliant with karen o 's ferocious singing charging it . <sssss> the movie flags a bit in the last 15 minutes , but then ends with a bittersweet & deeply felt sigh . <sssss> this is very rough stuff meant only for the serious film lover who make up all of fincher 's admirers .
ur0116181/	\tt0085809	10	i put this film in the same league as `` 2001 : a space odyssey '' and `` brazil '' as an unexplainable masterpiece . <sssss> it is a totally non-verbal experience that demands an open mind to fully enjoy . <sssss> it is an absolutely stunning assault on your senses . <sssss> godfrey reggio and his crew fill the screen with glorious images of nature that dissolve into mechanistic cityscapes that eventually mutate into an unseemly but seamless combination of dehumanizing and organic symmetry that expose the insane quality of urban life and the expense the our planet pays in its wake . <sssss> phillip glass 's score is graceful and pulsating exactly where it needs to be . <sssss> the music reaches the most dizzying climax of any musical work i 've ever heard . <sssss> it is also beautiful beyond words . <sssss> this film richly rewards anybody who allow themself to be fully immersed by it .

ur0550732/	\tt0253474	10	this film is still another story about the darkest times in our history . <sssss> it is beautifully done and should receive all the kudos it has been getting . <sssss> brody is fabulous in the role and although it is a very difficult movie to watch . <sssss> we must never forget and therefore we need to hear all the stories we can about survival and the horror of the 20th century .
ur0550732/	\tt0448075	9	we start all of our reviews with the following information . <sssss> my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . <sssss> recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! <sssss> so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . <sssss> the point of this is that critics count for zero . <sssss> your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . <sssss> the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! <sssss> we never ever listen or read the critics . <sssss> we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . <sssss> well enough about that . <sssss> robin williams is simply wonderful in the very exciting psychological thriller . <sssss> the entire small cast in this small independent movie is great toni collete is great . <sssss> a do n't miss movie if you can find it in your area . <sssss> it is very much robin williams best dramatic work since dead poets .
ur0550732/	\tt0256525	9	if you are real woody allen fan as i am , since the 1960 's , we absolutely loved this movie . <sssss> it was `` old funny '' woody as opposed to the newer more serious and strange woody . <sssss> this was vintage woody at his best . <sssss> 1940 's , great music , very funny script , one liners and woody just the way we love him . <sssss> helen hunt was great and is now among one of the movie stars we have . <sssss> charlize theron is simply gorgeous and although she had a small part in this movie , she was her usual beautiful sexy self . <sssss> we laughed and laughed and loved to see the old woody back . <sssss> at 65 he is still a writing and acting genius the likes of which do not exist in comedy .
ur0550732/	\tt0362227	10	we have seen 28 movies thus far this year and this one is the very best of the year . <sssss> certainly worthy of academy award nominations for the movie , spielberg and hanks . <sssss> only spielberg could make a movie like this , filmed entirely at the airport that he built completely from scratch including all the stores . <sssss> tom hanks is spectacular in this movie while barely speaking english for the entire movie . <sssss> catherine zeta is simply wonderful and gorgeous as usual . <sssss> the supporting cast of chi mc bride , stanely tucci and the others is perfect . <sssss> a ca n't miss film that can be seen by the entire family . <sssss> you will laugh hysterically and cry and have a great time . <sssss> the entire audience stood and applauded as the credits rolled by . <sssss> there is not better testament to a movie when the people in the audience react like that . <sssss> do n't miss it . <sssss> kudos to spielberg and hanks and everyone who made and wrote this movie .
ur0550732/	\tt0263757	9	dakota fanning is simply the newest hottest young star in hollywood . <sssss> she is 9 with the poise and acting ability of a 35 year old julia roberts . <sssss> words can not describe how good she is . <sssss> we have seen everything she has been in and she simply gets better with each movie . <sssss> what a fantastic kid . <sssss> the movie is fun for everyone , although it is not a comedy , it is billed as a dramady ! <sssss> and that suits it fine . <sssss> moral to the story and brittany murphy is charming in her role , more serious than the usually funny goofy roles played in the past . <sssss> it is a great night out .
ur0550732/	\tt0159365	8	we enjoyed the movie very much and agree that it should be considered for the oscar . <sssss> nicole kidman , jude law and renee zellwigger were simply wonderful in the movie . <sssss> the scenery and largeness of the movie was also superb . <sssss> we would recommend it to all . <sssss> it was a plain old fashioned good movie without sex , language and much special effects . <sssss> damn good acting .
ur0365713/	\tt0120841	3	this film is about as bad as you get when it comes to remakes or when it comes to any type of movie come to think of it . <sssss> it lacks any good acting , plot or dialogue and is truely awful . <sssss> all this film is is an alien shag fest , any excuse for a naked body and a bid of sex and they go for it big time -lrb- not that i 'm against that ! <sssss> -rrb- but they do over state it a lot . <sssss> you will laugh out loud at some of the lines these poor actors have to say.the worst thing about this movie is that the last scene indicated there will be another ! <sssss> god help us all . <sssss> 3 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0234215	8	i wasnt really looking forward to watching matrix reloaded for a couple of reasons . <sssss> first is that i didnt think the first film was as good as the hype and secondly the reviews all said that the storyline was complicated and difficult to understand . <sssss> after watching the film i was pleasantly suprised . <sssss> i enjoyed it . <sssss> it 's true that the story is complicated and i didnt understand it for one minute but thats not really important as long as you know who are the good guys and who are the bad bad guys that is enough because the action is fantastic . <sssss> im not a lover of martial arts film but this is the best i have seen as regards the fight scenes . <sssss> you have got to see the bit when the lead guy fights all the mr smiths in the courtyard , it is amazing . <sssss> so if your not sure if to watch the film then i say , do so . <sssss> forget about trying to understand the story because you wont . <sssss> just enjoy the action . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0288477	6	ghost ship is by no means the worst horror i have ever seen in fact some parts of this film are quite entertaining , the problem seems to be some of the poor digital computer special affect that make this film look like a bit of a b movie . <sssss> some of the affects are good expecially the opening scene where we see the crewe of the ship killed by a steel acting is ok and the characters are good so that when they are picked off one by one , you care . <sssss> there are a lot of question left unanswered though and in stages the scenes apear to have been put in any old order . <sssss> if you like horror and dont want a film you have to think about too much then i you give this a go . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0182843	8	boiler room in some reviews is compared to wall st and in a way it is but watching wall street now it looks dated , this isnt . <sssss> this is one of those film that you dont know too much about before watching it and um and ar about ever watching it , im glad i decided to give this a view . <sssss> the acting is superb . <sssss> as is the story and the director and writer , ben younger can only be applauded for coming up with such a watchable movie . <sssss> i also learnt something new , vin diesel can act . <sssss> having seen him in pitch black i thought he was just hired muscle but he is very good in this but the true star of the show is giovani ribisi who lights up the screen with his performance and that is not the first time i have said that about this brilliant and up and coming actor . <sssss> thus film is a treat and is not to be missed . <sssss> 8 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0120863	8	the thin red line is a very good war movie which reminded me a little of platoon in the way that it portrays the personalities fighting the war rather than the actual war itself . <sssss> the film is set around c platoon who try to take a hill which is heavily guarded by japanese follows three relationships in the movie.a sergeant and the corporal , a private and his wife and private and his sergeant . <sssss> the music fits to the film superbly and photography is great . <sssss> the acting is wonderfull epecially from sean penn , elias koteas and adrien brody . <sssss> if you want to watch this movie for the acting of george clooney , john travolta and woody harrelson you will be disapointed as they only have cameo roles . <sssss> 8 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0125664	7	before i watched the man on the moon i new very little about andy kaufman . <sssss> the only time we have seen him in the uk is his appearances on taxi . <sssss> i had no idea that he didnt speak with the squeaky voice in real life . <sssss> i had no idea that he was into wrestling in a big way and i had never heard of his cabaret act tony clifton , although i would love to see footage of him . <sssss> jim carey 's performance is one of his better ones and his moving performance can only do his cv good especially after some poor recent performances . <sssss> it is hard to tell what kaufman was all about , was he retarded in any way ? <sssss> that is not meant in a bad way but it does seem as though he was n't the full package at times . <sssss> childish seems the best way to describe him or is it carey 's performance that makes him look that way ? <sssss> entertaining biopic . <sssss> 7 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0132358	3	dont believe the hype ! <sssss> never a truer sentence said . <sssss> this is another of those films that was banned because of its controversial contents such as a clockwork orange and the exorcist and when you do actually get to see it you realise that it should stay banned , not because of the violence but because it is total drivel . <sssss> it 's difficult to explain what natural born killers is really trying to say because it is so wacky that it loses the viewer . <sssss> every great director , such as oliver stone , makes a turkey during his career and this is his . <sssss> even more irritating than the cartoon graphics and flashing lights is robert downy accent . <sssss> where is he supposed to be from ? <sssss> i hope he is not trying to put on an english accent , if so , its the worst since dick van dykes in mary poppins . <sssss> if you are into a film with a plot , great acting and superb direction ... leave this well alone . <sssss> 3 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0280969	3	if there was ever a film that lies about itself on it 's publicity posters it is my little eye . <sssss> the poster says `` truly terrifying '' and `` the real stuff of nightmares '' . <sssss> anybody who has seen this film we see what a joke these statements are . <sssss> if this film is terrifying then i must have fallen asleep at those . <sssss> i dont think i have seen a more duller horror flick than this in a very long time . <sssss> i remember looking at my watch after 70 minutes and thinking '' when is anything going to happen ?! '' <sssss> . <sssss> and before i knew it it was over and nothing of any interest had happened ! <sssss> im not a lover of american slasher / stalker movies such as scream but at least they have a bit of suspence this had none . <sssss> none what so ever . <sssss> the film looked like it had been pieced together by a primary school kid who had no idea in which order each scene should go . <sssss> appalling trash . <sssss> 3 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0169547	9	many people will interpret this movie in different ways . <sssss> some will tell you this film is about something deep and meaningfull but i would argue differently . <sssss> i think american pie is simply about people and more importantly its about us . <sssss> what is amazing about this film is that i know at least three of these characters ! <sssss> i know these people ! <sssss> the thing that most people will agree with is that film is brilliant . <sssss> a special mention must go to anette bening and kevin spacey who put in the performances of their careers . <sssss> i thought about giving this a 10 out of ten and maybe i will after i watch this film again but for the time being . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0077394	6	the problem with damien is it tries too much to be like the great omen movie . <sssss> we see damien now as a teenager who lives with his uncle -lrb- william holden -rrb- in america , he is a cadet in the military and he lives with his step brother and step mother too . <sssss> he starts off as a nice young man but as time goes by he starts to understand his purpose in life and who he is , thanks to some followers who are around him . <sssss> people start to realise he is the son of the devil and as they do they mysteriously pop their clogs in a nasty way . <sssss> this is not a patch the first for for a few reasons . <sssss> firstly it tries to be very like the omen and that was always going to be difficult , secondly the cast is poor . <sssss> the boy who plays damien is not scary enough , he is too camp and in no way scary , also william holden is no gregory peck although he does try and third it is very , very dated . <sssss> it is not all bad though , there are some scary moments and the twist in the end is a suprise which is good . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0118929	6	this film had an interesting concept about it and the special affects are fairly good to but for me it was far too dark and depressing . <sssss> the director is the same person who made the crow and i think he used the same set ! <sssss> the story is about a group of alien beings who , at midnight every night , send the population of this asleep in order to experiment on their minds in order to be more human . <sssss> but something goes wrong as someone fails to go to sleep and starts to uncover what is going on . <sssss> as a said a promising plot but all in all a bit of a let down . <sssss> 6 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0212338	8	ben stiller and robert de niro come up trumps with this very funny movie about a male nurse who wants to marry his girlfriend but finds out he needs to get her fathers permission . <sssss> they go to her parents house and that is where the fun starts . <sssss> robert de nero is definately getting a lot better at comedy and in this he is very funny as an ex cia over protective father . <sssss> there are many funny scenes in this film including the cat and the urn sketch and the airport scenes and ben stiller carries them off to perfection . <sssss> very enjoyable . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0094336	8	when withnail and i was first released it passed off without too much publicity but over the years it has gained cult status , especialy from the student population and you can see why . <sssss> richard e grant and paul mccann are brilliant as a pair of out of work actors who live a drug and drink hazed while waiting for their next dole cheque to fall on the door step . <sssss> grant especially is superb and really looks stoned throughout the movie and will do anything for his next shot of whisky or pint of ale and that includes setting up his homosexual uncle with his best friend on a trip to his county house . <sssss> the look of fear on his face when he is followed around the cottage by the lusty fat uncle is a joy ! <sssss> this a film that is not made great for its story but for it acting performance from all the cast and it 's a shame that there are not many films made like this anymore . <sssss> what i would love to see is a sequel 15 years later . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0217869	9	let me start by saying if on the dvd or video it says `` this is a follow up to the sixth sense '' take no notice . <sssss> while this film does have the same feel it is by no means a follow up . <sssss> unbreakable is in some ways better the the sixth sense because it really does make you think all the way through the film as to what is happening . <sssss> bruce willis plays security guard , david dunn , who is the only survivor in a train crash and is reminded by elijah price played by samuel l jackson that maybe there is more to his survival that meets the eye . <sssss> if you are expecting an all action movie forget it because it is not what this film is about . <sssss> if you are in to comic books you will love this although it is not a requirement . <sssss> like the sixth sence this has a twist that is unexpected and without saying what it is it is good ! <sssss> sit back and enjoy . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0092007	6	i would like to class myself as a hardcore star trek fan and being a fan i also nit pic when i comes to things that happen in film or episodes that go against the star trek grain . <sssss> the voyage home is nothing like any star trek film or episode before or since and because of that for me this film is poor . <sssss> for starters there are no fights or violence in this , apparently leonard nimoy who directed it wanted it like that , who has ever heard of a sci fi film with no action ? <sssss> this has no action at all accept the silly , round the sun , time travel that the crew go through to get to 20th century earth . <sssss> this must have made most star trek fans cringe -lrb- it did me ! <sssss> -rrb- what a kop out ! <sssss> . <sssss> and what about the head quarters on earth ? <sssss> when you see the different species that they invented just for the film that we have never seen in the franchise before ? <sssss> where is the explanation for this ? <sssss> if your not a fan of star trek then you might like this ... if you can see through the sentimentality . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0119099	9	boy oh boy was this a hell of a film . <sssss> fallen was far better than i was expecting . <sssss> denzel washington was superb as `` hobbs '' a cop who is caught up in a web of supernatural intrigue and murder . <sssss> i dont know if this was first a book , it seems the type of film that was , if so i bet it came over well as a film . <sssss> this also stars jon goodman and donald sutherland as fellow cops who are n't all they seem to be . <sssss> i would highly recomend anybody to watch this film as it is one of the best film i have seen all year . <sssss> great acting , great storyline and a fantasticly shot . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0190590	3	i have to the conclusion that when it comes to films from the coen brothers there is conspiracy going on . <sssss> first it was fargo , then the big lebowski and now this . <sssss> each of these films were given rave reviews for being classic comedies , the question is why ????????????? <sssss> fargo was dull and if it wasnt for willam h macy would have been unwatchable . <sssss> the big lebowski was as funny as piles and now this film takes the biscuit ! <sssss> o brother where art thou ? <sssss> is as unfunny as it is boring . <sssss> nothing of any significance happens to make the viewer laugh . <sssss> nothing happens to make this film interesting in any way . <sssss> goerge clooney does his best but the poor script makes it impossible for him to come out of this with any merit . <sssss> who ever decided that this rubbish should be rewarded with a golden globe had fall for what most critics have ... the coen con ! <sssss> i 'm pleased to say i 'm not following like all the other sheep , this film stinks ! <sssss> 3 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0208874	10	i have just finished watching an amazing political movie that left me gasping at it brilliance . <sssss> the script , the acting and story is quite simply outstanding . <sssss> joan allen plays a who is in line and is the prefered choice as vice president . <sssss> along the way there are poeple who dont like the idea of a woman being the president 's right hand man ... woman . <sssss> gary oldman plays the congress leader who rakes up sexual rumours and any inuendo to make sure she falls at the first hurdle . <sssss> oldman is wonderfull as is jeff bridges as the president . <sssss> the diologue is straight from the top drawer is has you gripped from the first minute and does not let go until the very end . <sssss> the contender is a contender for one of my all time favourites . <sssss> 10 out of 10
ur0365713/	\tt0186151	8	when this film was released as far as i am aware it did n't get a great deal of publicity and to be honest i had n't heard of it until it came out on dvd . <sssss> i am really glad i watched it because it is a little gem of a movie . <sssss> dennis quaid and jim caviezel star as father and son who through a freak of nature manage to communicate to each other by amateur radio even though they are 30 years apart . <sssss> the son manages to tell his father how to avoid his death which somehow leads to his mother being killed by a serial killer . <sssss> they then work together to try to stop his killings and trap the murderer . <sssss> this may sound like every other back in time film you have ever seen but dont because this is good ! <sssss> a very entertaining thriller not to be missed . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0160668	7	pitch black is an above average horror sci fi that goes a little bit further than just good special affects . <sssss> the story is about a group of people who crash land on a planet which is occupied by crazed aliens that live and hunt in the dark . <sssss> it just so happens that they land when the planet is set for its 22 yearly eclipse , setting these blood crazed loose . <sssss> the thing i like about this film apart from the story is that you never quite know who are the nice guys . <sssss> the human 's characters change throughout leaving you not sure who you want to die ! <sssss> the cast are unknown 's -lrb- unknown to me anyway -rrb- but this does not distract from the film , vin diesel coming out of this film with top marks but i wish he would change his name ! <sssss> not bad . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0120731	8	the legend of 1900 is a film i defy anybody not to like . <sssss> it is a moving film that has you hypnotised by it 's beauty and charm and leaves you wanting for more . <sssss> tim roth stars as a young man who was born on a cruise liner and is a musical genius , the problem is he can not leave the ship for reason 's that we try to learn to understand and ultimately are his downfall . <sssss> the man who tries to get him to leave and is his best friend is played by taylor vince and he , for me , is the star of the film . <sssss> i have vince before when i did a review of nurse betty but in this , he is the star , even above roth . <sssss> although this film is 2 hours long it flies by and in my opinion could even do with a little longer . <sssss> this is a gem and should not be missed . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0284953	8	i love the tv shows featuring ali g and i had read from many reviews that the film was not up to the standard of the shows . <sssss> while this is true it is wrong to compare the two . <sssss> the film is a completly different format from the tv series . <sssss> on the tv series we see ali g meeting every day people who have no idea who or what he is and he exploits the fact by basically taking the micky out of them without them knowing it . <sssss> the film is , just that ... a film . <sssss> it is in the same concept of the old carry on films , plenty of double en and lots of sexist and non pc jokes which unlike the carry on films are very funny . <sssss> ok , its about as far fetched as a film can get but as long as you realise that from the start and get into silly film film mode you should enjoy this as much as i did . <sssss> . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0083907	5	i remember when i first saw the evil dead 20 years ago in a bar in spain and i remember the excitement i felt when i watched the film.it was like nothing i had ever seen before and was talked about by all my fellow teenage mates . <sssss> in a funny sort of way i wished i looked at films now as i did then but then i was n't interested in how bad the acting was or how appalling the direction was and all i was concerned about was the blood and gore . <sssss> having watched the film again i can really see how some aspects of the film said that this film is still creepy and atmospheric but has dated incredibly badly . <sssss> bruce campbell 's performance as the leading man is so bad it borders on funny and must be one of the worst acting performances i have ever seen . <sssss> this film really smacks of a low budget movie but because of my teenage memories of siting in a bar in benidorm being scared out of my wits this film will always hold some good memories . <sssss> 5 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0099939	6	king of new york is a dark , humourless movie that instead of looking like it was made in 1990 looks like a film from the 70 's . <sssss> the lead role is superbly played by christopher walken who has massively under achieved over the last few years . <sssss> his lead role as mob boss overshadows other performances from wesley snipes and laurance fishburne -lrb- known as larry in the credits ! <sssss> -rrb- and is close to being his best performance i have seen . <sssss> it is the story of a gangland boss who is released from prison and starts to wack his rivals . <sssss> the police try to get him by fair means and foul and predictably things finish pear shaped . <sssss> this isnt a bad film but it hardly sets the world alight and it does look very , very dated . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0120891	6	i really was n't expecting wild , wild , west to be up to much after hearing from other people who had seen it and reading reviews but i must say it was n't that bad . <sssss> ok it certainly wont win any oscars because the storyline is non existant and the acting is hardly out of the top draw but it was good to look at . <sssss> when i mean it was good to look at i mean the special affect are very good and some of the mechanical contraptions were very good . <sssss> what did confuse me was why on earth was the film set in the west and 130 years ago ? <sssss> it certainly didnt have much relevance to the story . <sssss> call me cynical but did will smith produce the song before the story was made ? <sssss> it would n't suprise me . <sssss> this is one for the kids . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0088170	6	they say that the star trek movies that are released as an odd number -lrb- this is no3 -rrb- are the poorest films . <sssss> i would n't say this is poor it actually fairly good but there are some aspects of this film that are a little irritating . <sssss> the main problem i have with the search for spock is the casting of the klingon leader . <sssss> who on earth decided christopher lloyd would be good as the bad guy ?? <sssss> he is as about as convincing as the cookie monster would be in the new alien movie ! <sssss> the film is a little slow at times but it is the first star trek movie that does not look to dated apart from the 1984 curly , shiny afros that were trendy at the time . <sssss> kool in the gang eat your heart out ! <sssss> if your a kirk fan you will like this , if not then i would say clear . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0124315	8	the cider house rules is well acted movie that has an uncomplicated story and is a pleasure to watch . <sssss> ***** spoiler alert ******** tobey maguire plays a young man who is brought up in an orphanage by a doctor -lrb- michael caine -rrb- and is taught how to perform births and abortions on young woman who come to the orphanage for help . <sssss> he decides to leave and find his own way in life and accepts a job from a young woman -lrb- theron -rrb- who has an abortion at the surgery . <sssss> he learns to pick cider apples at her family 's farm and ends up falling in love with her while her boyfriend is away fighting in the war . <sssss> he lives with a family of black apple pickers and ends up performing an abortion on the daughter who is have a baby by her father , superbly played by delroy go from bad to worse and he ends up going back to the orphanage after the death of his mentor to become the head doctor . <sssss> the biggest plus point from this film is the acting . <sssss> tobey maguire is superb as is theron and delroy lindo but suprisingly the acadamy award went to michael caine . <sssss> caine is good but i was slightly put off by the accent he was trying to do . <sssss> why didnt he just use his normal accent ? <sssss> he did explain that he was an after all . <sssss> one gaff to point out is when rose rose is stitching up her father 's finger , homer winces because of the sight of the blood which is very strange considering he performs births and abortions ! <sssss> 8 out of 10 .

ur0365713/	\tt0145681	8	i was trying to think back after watching the bone collector if denzil washington has actually made a bad film and i could not think of one and certainly the bone collector has added to his impressive list of entertaining movies . <sssss> the shame is his leading lady in this film , not known for her acting ability but for her gormless expressions and lip pouting and she does a lot of it in this film . <sssss> the bone collector is about a serial killer who kidnaps people from the back of his taxi and leaves the forensic clues for the rookie cop , angelina jolie -lrb- and rookie actress by the look of it -rrb- to find out who the killer is . <sssss> although this film does leave a lot of questions unanswered it is also very clever and very scary too . <sssss> so turn the lights out , pop the video in the recorder and be prepared to be entertained . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0215129	6	on the cover of all the sell through dvd 's and video 's it has plastered all over the cover `` what you did n't see at the cinema '' '' unseen & explicit '' well after just watching this i am at a loss to as what they cut out when it was shown at the cinema . <sssss> as far as adult humour goes road trip is quite tame compared to recent american college movies . <sssss> that is not to say this film does not have any funny moment 's because it does . <sssss> not enough for my liking . <sssss> it has the usual college romp feel about it which is a shame because there are far to many of these type of films and i hope this is the last for a very long time . <sssss> this stars tom green who is aparently the next big thing in the states . <sssss> he obviously had an off day when he decided to star in road trip . <sssss> not a bad film but we have seen it all before . <sssss> 6 out of 10 .

ur0365713/	\tt0181536	8	i watched finding forrester on an plane on the way back from san fran sisco which is not always the best way to watch a movie but i must say this did not spoil the enjoyment of this super film . <sssss> rob brown stars as a black guy from the bronx who befriends a reclusive author , sean connery who goes on to help in his academic studies and his battle against a teacher who is against the boy doing well . <sssss> the acting performances are superb as is the script and it is hard to fault this film in any way . <sssss> rob brown looks like going far . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .

ur0365713/	\tt0313540	5	i watched rose red in its full form and not as a mini series and almost instantly you can see that there is not enough of a story here to fill 5 hours . <sssss> stephen king has done this type of thing before with the stand and it and for me they have been a success but somehow this does not work . <sssss> maybe it is the poor computer special affect or the not so hi tech dead guys or it could be that at no stage do you feel in the slightest bit spooked by what goes on in rose red . <sssss> i would highly recommend that you steer clear of this unless you are into tv movies big time . <sssss> 5 out of 10 .

ur0365713/	\tt0248631	9	having watched chocolat i so wanted to have a rant at how this film is about the fight against the bile and hatred that is religion but if i did this would distract from what is a very good film that deserves better comments than my anti religious rantings . <sssss> juliette binoche lights up this delightful film as does all the cast and it is unusual to have a film that has johnny depp in it and not have too much to say about his role . <sssss> not that it 's bad , it good ` but all the characters are so interesting and well acted he is overshadowed a little . <sssss> i would recommend this movie to anyone , it appeals to all and although two hours long , it flies by . <sssss> 9 out of 10 .
ur0365713/	\tt0120695	7	you know , this film aint too bad at all ! <sssss> this is an entertaining horror flick that returns to the quality of the first film and away from the pure drivel of the second movie . <sssss> this is set in the past and we see the vampire club as it was in the past . <sssss> like the first movie in this we see no monster action for the first half and pure blood sucking gore for the entire second half of the film . <sssss> this not to say the first half is poor because it is n't . <sssss> again like the first movie the first half is different yet very watchable . <sssss> the acting is very good and the special affect are ok if not story is hardly ground breaking but at times this is very funny and in the moments when it was supposed to be , not like in the second movie when it was funny when they were trying to be serious ! <sssss> an above average horror that is hard not to like . <sssss> 7 out of 10 .

ur0365713/	\tt0165798	8	first let me start by saying that the title of this movie must of put many people off watching this straight away which is a complete shame because this movie is a treat . <sssss> forest whitaker stars as a hit man who follows the ways of the samurai . <sssss> he upsets a group of gangsters by not carrying out a job to their satisfaction so they decide he has to be whacked . <sssss> they picked the wrong guy , he himself takes them out one by one . <sssss> what i really found confusing was why they wanted him dead ? <sssss> did i miss something ? <sssss> whitaker is superb as the loner and pulls off this role to the way through the film he reads text from a book about the life of the samurai which is a very good touch to the film . <sssss> this is a little gem . <sssss> 8 out of 10 .
