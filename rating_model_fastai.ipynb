based tale of a small -lrb- hick -rrb- town poisoned by a giant utility has `` rocky '' - like xxunk in it and they feel all earned . < xxrep 5 s > the fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings . < xxrep 5 s > director steven soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated `` out of sight '' . < xxrep 5 s > this is an `` adult '' movie in the very best sense of that term . < xxrep 5 s > `` erin brockovich '' is definitely a big hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it . < xxrep 5 s > it also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly . < xxrep 5 s > it is the first best picture nominee for next year .,xxbos my expectations for writer / director m. night shyamalan 's next movie after `` the sixth sense '' were extremely high and `` unbreakable '' did not let me down . < xxrep 5 s > in fact , in some respects , it is a better and more self assured movie than the former . < xxrep 5 s > like `` 6th '' , `` un '' is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and i 'll be damned if i ' m gon na give anything away here . < xxrep 5 s > however i will say that bruce willis and samuel l. jackson -lrb- has this guy ever given a bad performance ? < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- are outstanding as the leads . < xxrep 5 s > there is not a wasted role in the movie . < xxrep 5 s > shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality . < xxrep 5 s > the spirit of rod serling lives in him . < xxrep 5 s > his direction and writing are a xxunk blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions . < xxrep 5 s > he is aided greatly by james newton howard 's brilliant score and eduardo xxunk 's daring cinematography . < xxrep 5 s > this movie takes more chances than `` 6th '' . < xxrep 5 s > you either buy it or you do n't . < xxrep 5 s > it has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust . < xxrep 5 s > `` un '' does n't benefit from `` 6th '' 's shock value , but i think is a more accomplished piece overall . < xxrep 5 s > it and `` erin brokovich are clearly this year 's 2 best movies .\n",

< xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > angelina jolie and dan xxunk and the entire cast take us through what happened in the search for danny pearl that we did not see or hear about in the press as they frantically tried to find him before he was so brutally killed . < xxrep 5 s > a very poignant love story with a horrific ending . < xxrep 5 s > kudos to marianne pearl and angelina jolie and brad pitt who produced the movie .,xxbos my wife and i see over 100 movies a year , having been in the business and now retired . < xxrep 5 s > we do not read any reviews by anyone . < xxrep 5 s > we try to tell our friends that a critic is one person , he or she is not us . < xxrep 5 s > critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear . < xxrep 5 s > therefore , our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre . < xxrep 5 s > many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction . < xxrep 5 s > how can you review a movie without the real deal ? < xxrep 5 s > a great movie with all three stars giving academy award performances amy adams , mark wahlberg and christian bale . < xxrep 5 s > one of the best fight films we have ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > amy adams does her usual fabulous job in still another type of roll . < xxrep 5 s > wahlberg has become a terrific actor and director and christan bale steals the movie with his great acting . < xxrep 5 s > do n't miss it .,xxbos we see over 75 movies a year and have not rated one a perfect 10 for over 3 years . < xxrep 5 s > this is the perfect movie . < xxrep 5 s > pixar is amazing . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the storyline to the characters to the unbelievable graphics are spectacular . < xxrep 5 s > hats off to pixar may they strike a new deal with disney and keep them coming . < xxrep 5 s > never expected them to top toy story , then toy story ii and now this is even better . < xxrep 5 s > wow !\n",

       "xxbos edward norton is right & wrong . < xxrep 5 s > this movie could have used more of him in it -lrb- when the dvd comes out i hope they include `` his cut '' if it exist -rrb- , but he is wrong for not promoting this movie . < xxrep 5 s > this re - boot is a blast to watch . < xxrep 5 s > i actually liked much of ang lee 's version but only in fits & starts . < xxrep 5 s > this hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags . < xxrep 5 s > the fx are spectacular & sometimes inspired -- every part of the production is great . < xxrep 5 s > the battle scenes are ferocious . < xxrep 5 s > i never tired of watching mean green do his thing , but i guess that s the point . < xxrep 5 s > the movie makers knew when to cut the action . < xxrep 5 s > however -- like iron man -- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism , but , come to think of it , all 3 xxunk & x - men + batman begins -lrb- & returns -rrb- also featured really fine & often great acting . < xxrep 5 s > and this hulk could ' ve used more of it . < xxrep 5 s > norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working . < xxrep 5 s > there are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief . < xxrep 5 s > william hurt makes a fine foe . < xxrep 5 s > and , so help me movie gods , liv tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name `` bruce '' . < xxrep 5 s > overall this movie rocks . < xxrep 5 s > and i thought all movies released xxunk july 18th were just until the dark knight arrives . < xxrep 5 s > thank you tony stark , indy & bruce banner for proving me wrong .,xxbos it is no surprise that gary ross -- the writer of big and dave -- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen , but what is surprising is the level of directorial xxunk that he brings to a very complex undertaking . < xxrep 5 s > pleasantville is a wonderful laugh - out - loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . < xxrep 5 s > but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . < xxrep 5 s > any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . < xxrep 5 s > the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . < xxrep 5 s > tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . < xxrep 5 s > maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . < xxrep 5 s > witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . < xxrep 5 s > and allen , like she did in face / off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . < xxrep 5 s > this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . < xxrep 5 s > the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i ' ve ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . < xxrep 5 s > it is fantastic . < xxrep 5 s > the seamless blend of color and black - and - white ceases to become an issue very early on . < xxrep 5 s > you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . < xxrep 5 s > fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . < xxrep 5 s > some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . < xxrep 5 s > my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . < xxrep 5 s > next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far .,xxbos there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . < xxrep 5 s > michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . < xxrep 5 s > the survivors suffer more than the dead . < xxrep 5 s > i know a lot of knee - jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . < xxrep 5 s > this film could have been set in any war . < xxrep 5 s > i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . < xxrep 5 s > and of course the acting was brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . < xxrep 5 s > but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? < xxrep 5 s > the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . < xxrep 5 s > his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . < xxrep 5 s > the xxunk is easily one of the top 20 films i ' ve ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . < xxrep 5 s > its oscars were richly deserved .,xxbos 2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and i. million dollar baby is a sure fire xxunk award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the writing , directing , acting and even the music by clint eastwood is brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > hillary swank is once again one of our best actresses . < xxrep 5 s > . < xxrep 5 s > do n't know why she does n't make more movies and do some as a `` real lady '' which she certainly is . < xxrep 5 s > her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role . < xxrep 5 s > the chemistry between her and the fabulous clint eastwood who i believe is past 70 years old is wonderful . < xxrep 5 s > clint is simply great in anything that he does , from those old spaghetti westerns , to dirty harry to the comedies , acting , directing , singing , you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else . < xxrep 5 s > he is a fall back to the greats of hollywood . < xxrep 5 s > what can you say about morgan freeman . < xxrep 5 s > i can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied . < xxrep 5 s > he is mesmerizing with his tones . < xxrep 5 s > as an actor , he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting . < xxrep 5 s > he is one of the finest actors in hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber . < xxrep 5 s > he is great as the go between with clint eastwood and hillary swank in this movie and he does it with such ease . < xxrep 5 s > i would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves .,xxbos we start all of our reviews with the following information . < xxrep 5 s > my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . < xxrep 5 s > recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! < xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > a very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms . < xxrep 5 s > dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick . < xxrep 5 s > meryl streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the `` super bitch '' of the fashion magazine business . < xxrep 5 s > stanley tucci is his usual wonderful self as the `` gay '' assistant . < xxrep 5 s > anne hathaway continues to grow as an actress .\n",

mouthed , fiery , sensitive , funny and , of course , very sexy . < xxrep 5 s > it is one of best performances i ' ve ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of susan sarandon 's annie savoy from `` bull durham '' in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- of course annie savoy is purely fictional whereas erin brockovich is not . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i sense that her character may appeal more to men than women -lrb- her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film -rrb- . < xxrep 5 s > the reviews i ' ve read have been excellent , but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well . < xxrep 5 s > finney 's work is more nuanced than roberts ' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions . < xxrep 5 s > aaron eckhardt deserves mention too as roberts ' good guy biker boyfriend . < xxrep 5 s > these performances are made possible by a superb script from susannah grant . < xxrep 5 s > her fact - based tale of a small -lrb- hick -rrb- town poisoned by a giant utility has `` rocky '' - like xxunk in it and they feel all earned . < xxrep 5 s > the fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings . < xxrep 5 s > director steven soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated `` out of sight '' . < xxrep 5 s > this is an `` adult '' movie in the very best sense of that term . < xxrep 5 s > `` erin brockovich '' is definitely a big hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it . < xxrep 5 s > it also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly . < xxrep 5 s > it is the first best picture nominee for next year .,xxbos my expectations for writer / director m. night shyamalan 's next movie after `` the sixth sense '' were extremely high and `` unbreakable '' did not let me down . < xxrep 5 s > in fact , in some respects , it is a better and more self assured movie than the former . < xxrep 5 s > like `` 6th '' , `` un '' is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and i 'll be damned if i ' m gon na give anything away here . < xxrep 5 s > however i will say that bruce willis and samuel l. jackson -lrb- has this guy ever given a bad performance ? < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- are outstanding as the leads . < xxrep 5 s > there is not a wasted role in the movie . < xxrep 5 s > shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality . < xxrep 5 s > the spirit of rod serling lives in him . < xxrep 5 s > his direction and writing are a xxunk blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions . < xxrep 5 s > he is aided greatly by james newton howard 's brilliant score and eduardo xxunk 's daring cinematography . < xxrep 5 s > this movie takes more chances than `` 6th '' . < xxrep 5 s > you either buy it or you do n't . < xxrep 5 s > it has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust . < xxrep 5 s > `` un '' does n't benefit from `` 6th '' 's shock value , but i think is a more accomplished piece overall . < xxrep 5 s > it and `` erin brokovich are clearly this year 's 2 best movies .\n",

< xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > angelina jolie and dan xxunk and the entire cast take us through what happened in the search for danny pearl that we did not see or hear about in the press as they frantically tried to find him before he was so brutally killed . < xxrep 5 s > a very poignant love story with a horrific ending . < xxrep 5 s > kudos to marianne pearl and angelina jolie and brad pitt who produced the movie .,xxbos my wife and i see over 100 movies a year , having been in the business and now retired . < xxrep 5 s > we do not read any reviews by anyone . < xxrep 5 s > we try to tell our friends that a critic is one person , he or she is not us . < xxrep 5 s > critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear . < xxrep 5 s > therefore , our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre . < xxrep 5 s > many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction . < xxrep 5 s > how can you review a movie without the real deal ? < xxrep 5 s > a great movie with all three stars giving academy award performances amy adams , mark wahlberg and christian bale . < xxrep 5 s > one of the best fight films we have ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > amy adams does her usual fabulous job in still another type of roll . < xxrep 5 s > wahlberg has become a terrific actor and director and christan bale steals the movie with his great acting . < xxrep 5 s > do n't miss it .,xxbos we see over 75 movies a year and have not rated one a perfect 10 for over 3 years . < xxrep 5 s > this is the perfect movie . < xxrep 5 s > pixar is amazing . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the storyline to the characters to the unbelievable graphics are spectacular . < xxrep 5 s > hats off to pixar may they strike a new deal with disney and keep them coming . < xxrep 5 s > never expected them to top toy story , then toy story ii and now this is even better . < xxrep 5 s > wow !\n",

       "xxbos edward norton is right & wrong . < xxrep 5 s > this movie could have used more of him in it -lrb- when the dvd comes out i hope they include `` his cut '' if it exist -rrb- , but he is wrong for not promoting this movie . < xxrep 5 s > this re - boot is a blast to watch . < xxrep 5 s > i actually liked much of ang lee 's version but only in fits & starts . < xxrep 5 s > this hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags . < xxrep 5 s > the fx are spectacular & sometimes inspired -- every part of the production is great . < xxrep 5 s > the battle scenes are ferocious . < xxrep 5 s > i never tired of watching mean green do his thing , but i guess that s the point . < xxrep 5 s > the movie makers knew when to cut the action . < xxrep 5 s > however -- like iron man -- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism , but , come to think of it , all 3 xxunk & x - men + batman begins -lrb- & returns -rrb- also featured really fine & often great acting . < xxrep 5 s > and this hulk could ' ve used more of it . < xxrep 5 s > norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working . < xxrep 5 s > there are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief . < xxrep 5 s > william hurt makes a fine foe . < xxrep 5 s > and , so help me movie gods , liv tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name `` bruce '' . < xxrep 5 s > overall this movie rocks . < xxrep 5 s > and i thought all movies released xxunk july 18th were just until the dark knight arrives . < xxrep 5 s > thank you tony stark , indy & bruce banner for proving me wrong .,xxbos it is no surprise that gary ross -- the writer of big and dave -- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen , but what is surprising is the level of directorial xxunk that he brings to a very complex undertaking . < xxrep 5 s > pleasantville is a wonderful laugh - out - loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . < xxrep 5 s > but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . < xxrep 5 s > any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . < xxrep 5 s > the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . < xxrep 5 s > tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . < xxrep 5 s > maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . < xxrep 5 s > witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . < xxrep 5 s > and allen , like she did in face / off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . < xxrep 5 s > this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . < xxrep 5 s > the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i ' ve ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . < xxrep 5 s > it is fantastic . < xxrep 5 s > the seamless blend of color and black - and - white ceases to become an issue very early on . < xxrep 5 s > you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . < xxrep 5 s > fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . < xxrep 5 s > some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . < xxrep 5 s > my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . < xxrep 5 s > next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far .,xxbos there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . < xxrep 5 s > michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . < xxrep 5 s > the survivors suffer more than the dead . < xxrep 5 s > i know a lot of knee - jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . < xxrep 5 s > this film could have been set in any war . < xxrep 5 s > i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . < xxrep 5 s > and of course the acting was brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . < xxrep 5 s > but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? < xxrep 5 s > the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . < xxrep 5 s > his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . < xxrep 5 s > the xxunk is easily one of the top 20 films i ' ve ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . < xxrep 5 s > its oscars were richly deserved .,xxbos 2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and i. million dollar baby is a sure fire xxunk award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the writing , directing , acting and even the music by clint eastwood is brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > hillary swank is once again one of our best actresses . < xxrep 5 s > . < xxrep 5 s > do n't know why she does n't make more movies and do some as a `` real lady '' which she certainly is . < xxrep 5 s > her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role . < xxrep 5 s > the chemistry between her and the fabulous clint eastwood who i believe is past 70 years old is wonderful . < xxrep 5 s > clint is simply great in anything that he does , from those old spaghetti westerns , to dirty harry to the comedies , acting , directing , singing , you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else . < xxrep 5 s > he is a fall back to the greats of hollywood . < xxrep 5 s > what can you say about morgan freeman . < xxrep 5 s > i can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied . < xxrep 5 s > he is mesmerizing with his tones . < xxrep 5 s > as an actor , he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting . < xxrep 5 s > he is one of the finest actors in hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber . < xxrep 5 s > he is great as the go between with clint eastwood and hillary swank in this movie and he does it with such ease . < xxrep 5 s > i would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves .,xxbos we start all of our reviews with the following information . < xxrep 5 s > my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . < xxrep 5 s > recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! < xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > a very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms . < xxrep 5 s > dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick . < xxrep 5 s > meryl streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the `` super bitch '' of the fashion magazine business . < xxrep 5 s > stanley tucci is his usual wonderful self as the `` gay '' assistant . < xxrep 5 s > anne hathaway continues to grow as an actress .\n",

ass and all - knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability . < xxrep 5 s > this film is very dark but like `` bringing out the dead '' there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end . < xxrep 5 s > i was floored by this . < xxrep 5 s > it is also a very funny film . < xxrep 5 s > american beauty may be the best film of a very good year .,xxbos this movie does not belong in a cinema . < xxrep 5 s > it belongs in a museum of modern art running in a continuous loop . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- at least `` melancholia '' has a plot . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- terrence malick 's ruminations on the difficulty of balancing nature & grace is beautiful bore . < xxrep 5 s > there are images in this film that are as breathtaking as any i ' ve ever seen in cinema . < xxrep 5 s > the 19 minute sequence that depicts `` creation '' is easily worthy of favorable comparison to `` 2001 '' 's `` voyage beyond infinity '' sequence . < xxrep 5 s > i was practically floating out of my chair while watching -- experiencing -- it . < xxrep 5 s > it also features a couple of brief dinosaur scenes which surpass any in `` jurassic park '' in terms of sheer realization & beauty . < xxrep 5 s > this portion of the film was definitely worth the effort put into creating it . < xxrep 5 s > but there are 2 other hours of this film which occasionally stir emotions & do n't really connect to anything except malick 's own cosmic navel gazing . < xxrep 5 s > i love `` 2001 '' , `` walkabout ' , `` '' & `` brazil '' . < xxrep 5 s > `` the tree of life '' shares these films uniqueness & sense of wonder but did n't connect with me on a deeper level like them . < xxrep 5 s > call me a low brow , but i 'll take `` caption america : the first avenger '' over this film any day .,xxbos the first nominees for next year 's oscars in the best picture , best actress , best supporting actor , best director , best original or adapted screenplay and best costume design categories have already been secured with the arrival of `` erin brockovich '' . < xxrep 5 s > julia roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in u.s . history . < xxrep 5 s > she would ' ve stole every scene if it was n't for her co - star albert finney who matches her for every . < xxrep 5 s > he plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight . < xxrep 5 s > although her box office says otherwise i ' ve always thought roberts was way overrated as a movie star . < xxrep 5 s > now i ' m a believer . < xxrep 5 s > she is smart , sassy , foul - mouthed , fiery , sensitive , funny and , of course , very sexy . < xxrep 5 s > it is one of best performances i ' ve ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of susan sarandon 's annie savoy from `` bull durham '' in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- of course annie savoy is purely fictional whereas erin brockovich is not . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i sense that her character may appeal more to men than women -lrb- her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film -rrb- . < xxrep 5 s > the reviews i ' ve read have been excellent , but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well . < xxrep 5 s > finney 's work is more nuanced than roberts ' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions . < xxrep 5 s > aaron eckhardt deserves mention too as roberts ' good guy biker boyfriend . < xxrep 5 s > these performances are made possible by a superb script from susannah grant . < xxrep 5 s > her fact - based tale of a small -lrb- hick -rrb- town poisoned by a giant utility has `` rocky '' - like xxunk in it and they feel all earned . < xxrep 5 s > the fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings . < xxrep 5 s > director steven soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated `` out of sight '' . < xxrep 5 s > this is an `` adult '' movie in the very best sense of that term . < xxrep 5 s > `` erin brockovich '' is definitely a big hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it . < xxrep 5 s > it also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly . < xxrep 5 s > it is the first best picture nominee for next year .,xxbos my expectations for writer / director m. night shyamalan 's next movie after `` the sixth sense '' were extremely high and `` unbreakable '' did not let me down . < xxrep 5 s > in fact , in some respects , it is a better and more self assured movie than the former . < xxrep 5 s > like `` 6th '' , `` un '' is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and i 'll be damned if i ' m gon na give anything away here . < xxrep 5 s > however i will say that bruce willis and samuel l. jackson -lrb- has this guy ever given a bad performance ? < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- are outstanding as the leads . < xxrep 5 s > there is not a wasted role in the movie . < xxrep 5 s > shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality . < xxrep 5 s > the spirit of rod serling lives in him . < xxrep 5 s > his direction and writing are a xxunk blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions . < xxrep 5 s > he is aided greatly by james newton howard 's brilliant score and eduardo xxunk 's daring cinematography . < xxrep 5 s > this movie takes more chances than `` 6th '' . < xxrep 5 s > you either buy it or you do n't . < xxrep 5 s > it has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust . < xxrep 5 s > `` un '' does n't benefit from `` 6th '' 's shock value , but i think is a more accomplished piece overall . < xxrep 5 s > it and `` erin brokovich are clearly this year 's 2 best movies .\n",

< xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > angelina jolie and dan xxunk and the entire cast take us through what happened in the search for danny pearl that we did not see or hear about in the press as they frantically tried to find him before he was so brutally killed . < xxrep 5 s > a very poignant love story with a horrific ending . < xxrep 5 s > kudos to marianne pearl and angelina jolie and brad pitt who produced the movie .,xxbos my wife and i see over 100 movies a year , having been in the business and now retired . < xxrep 5 s > we do not read any reviews by anyone . < xxrep 5 s > we try to tell our friends that a critic is one person , he or she is not us . < xxrep 5 s > critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear . < xxrep 5 s > therefore , our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre . < xxrep 5 s > many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction . < xxrep 5 s > how can you review a movie without the real deal ? < xxrep 5 s > a great movie with all three stars giving academy award performances amy adams , mark wahlberg and christian bale . < xxrep 5 s > one of the best fight films we have ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > amy adams does her usual fabulous job in still another type of roll . < xxrep 5 s > wahlberg has become a terrific actor and director and christan bale steals the movie with his great acting . < xxrep 5 s > do n't miss it .,xxbos we see over 75 movies a year and have not rated one a perfect 10 for over 3 years . < xxrep 5 s > this is the perfect movie . < xxrep 5 s > pixar is amazing . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the storyline to the characters to the unbelievable graphics are spectacular . < xxrep 5 s > hats off to pixar may they strike a new deal with disney and keep them coming . < xxrep 5 s > never expected them to top toy story , then toy story ii and now this is even better . < xxrep 5 s > wow !\n",

       "xxbos edward norton is right & wrong . < xxrep 5 s > this movie could have used more of him in it -lrb- when the dvd comes out i hope they include `` his cut '' if it exist -rrb- , but he is wrong for not promoting this movie . < xxrep 5 s > this re - boot is a blast to watch . < xxrep 5 s > i actually liked much of ang lee 's version but only in fits & starts . < xxrep 5 s > this hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags . < xxrep 5 s > the fx are spectacular & sometimes inspired -- every part of the production is great . < xxrep 5 s > the battle scenes are ferocious . < xxrep 5 s > i never tired of watching mean green do his thing , but i guess that s the point . < xxrep 5 s > the movie makers knew when to cut the action . < xxrep 5 s > however -- like iron man -- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism , but , come to think of it , all 3 xxunk & x - men + batman begins -lrb- & returns -rrb- also featured really fine & often great acting . < xxrep 5 s > and this hulk could ' ve used more of it . < xxrep 5 s > norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working . < xxrep 5 s > there are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief . < xxrep 5 s > william hurt makes a fine foe . < xxrep 5 s > and , so help me movie gods , liv tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name `` bruce '' . < xxrep 5 s > overall this movie rocks . < xxrep 5 s > and i thought all movies released xxunk july 18th were just until the dark knight arrives . < xxrep 5 s > thank you tony stark , indy & bruce banner for proving me wrong .,xxbos it is no surprise that gary ross -- the writer of big and dave -- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen , but what is surprising is the level of directorial xxunk that he brings to a very complex undertaking . < xxrep 5 s > pleasantville is a wonderful laugh - out - loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . < xxrep 5 s > but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . < xxrep 5 s > any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . < xxrep 5 s > the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . < xxrep 5 s > tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . < xxrep 5 s > maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . < xxrep 5 s > witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . < xxrep 5 s > and allen , like she did in face / off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . < xxrep 5 s > this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . < xxrep 5 s > the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i ' ve ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . < xxrep 5 s > it is fantastic . < xxrep 5 s > the seamless blend of color and black - and - white ceases to become an issue very early on . < xxrep 5 s > you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . < xxrep 5 s > fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . < xxrep 5 s > some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . < xxrep 5 s > my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . < xxrep 5 s > next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far .,xxbos there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . < xxrep 5 s > michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . < xxrep 5 s > the survivors suffer more than the dead . < xxrep 5 s > i know a lot of knee - jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . < xxrep 5 s > this film could have been set in any war . < xxrep 5 s > i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . < xxrep 5 s > and of course the acting was brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . < xxrep 5 s > but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? < xxrep 5 s > the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . < xxrep 5 s > his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . < xxrep 5 s > the xxunk is easily one of the top 20 films i ' ve ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . < xxrep 5 s > its oscars were richly deserved .,xxbos 2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and i. million dollar baby is a sure fire xxunk award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the writing , directing , acting and even the music by clint eastwood is brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > hillary swank is once again one of our best actresses . < xxrep 5 s > . < xxrep 5 s > do n't know why she does n't make more movies and do some as a `` real lady '' which she certainly is . < xxrep 5 s > her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role . < xxrep 5 s > the chemistry between her and the fabulous clint eastwood who i believe is past 70 years old is wonderful . < xxrep 5 s > clint is simply great in anything that he does , from those old spaghetti westerns , to dirty harry to the comedies , acting , directing , singing , you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else . < xxrep 5 s > he is a fall back to the greats of hollywood . < xxrep 5 s > what can you say about morgan freeman . < xxrep 5 s > i can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied . < xxrep 5 s > he is mesmerizing with his tones . < xxrep 5 s > as an actor , he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting . < xxrep 5 s > he is one of the finest actors in hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber . < xxrep 5 s > he is great as the go between with clint eastwood and hillary swank in this movie and he does it with such ease . < xxrep 5 s > i would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves .,xxbos we start all of our reviews with the following information . < xxrep 5 s > my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . < xxrep 5 s > recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! < xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > a very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms . < xxrep 5 s > dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick . < xxrep 5 s > meryl streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the `` super bitch '' of the fashion magazine business . < xxrep 5 s > stanley tucci is his usual wonderful self as the `` gay '' assistant . < xxrep 5 s > anne hathaway continues to grow as an actress .\n",

out - loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . < xxrep 5 s > but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . < xxrep 5 s > any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . < xxrep 5 s > the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . < xxrep 5 s > tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . < xxrep 5 s > maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . < xxrep 5 s > witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . < xxrep 5 s > and allen , like she did in face / off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . < xxrep 5 s > this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . < xxrep 5 s > the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i ' ve ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . < xxrep 5 s > it is fantastic . < xxrep 5 s > the seamless blend of color and black - and - white ceases to become an issue very early on . < xxrep 5 s > you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . < xxrep 5 s > fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . < xxrep 5 s > some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . < xxrep 5 s > my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . < xxrep 5 s > next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far .,xxbos there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . < xxrep 5 s > michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . < xxrep 5 s > the survivors suffer more than the dead . < xxrep 5 s > i know a lot of knee - jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . < xxrep 5 s > this film could have been set in any war . < xxrep 5 s > i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . < xxrep 5 s > and of course the acting was brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . < xxrep 5 s > but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? < xxrep 5 s > the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . < xxrep 5 s > his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . < xxrep 5 s > the xxunk is easily one of the top 20 films i ' ve ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . < xxrep 5 s > its oscars were richly deserved .,xxbos 2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and i. million dollar baby is a sure fire xxunk award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the writing , directing , acting and even the music by clint eastwood is brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > hillary swank is once again one of our best actresses . < xxrep 5 s > . < xxrep 5 s > do n't know why she does n't make more movies and do some as a `` real lady '' which she certainly is . < xxrep 5 s > her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role . < xxrep 5 s > the chemistry between her and the fabulous clint eastwood who i believe is past 70 years old is wonderful . < xxrep 5 s > clint is simply great in anything that he does , from those old spaghetti westerns , to dirty harry to the comedies , acting , directing , singing , you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else . < xxrep 5 s > he is a fall back to the greats of hollywood . < xxrep 5 s > what can you say about morgan freeman . < xxrep 5 s > i can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied . < xxrep 5 s > he is mesmerizing with his tones . < xxrep 5 s > as an actor , he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting . < xxrep 5 s > he is one of the finest actors in hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber . < xxrep 5 s > he is great as the go between with clint eastwood and hillary swank in this movie and he does it with such ease . < xxrep 5 s > i would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves .,xxbos we start all of our reviews with the following information . < xxrep 5 s > my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . < xxrep 5 s > recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! < xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > a very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms . < xxrep 5 s > dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick . < xxrep 5 s > meryl streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the `` super bitch '' of the fashion magazine business . < xxrep 5 s > stanley tucci is his usual wonderful self as the `` gay '' assistant . < xxrep 5 s > anne hathaway continues to grow as an actress .\n",

ass and all - knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability . < xxrep 5 s > this film is very dark but like `` bringing out the dead '' there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end . < xxrep 5 s > i was floored by this . < xxrep 5 s > it is also a very funny film . < xxrep 5 s > american beauty may be the best film of a very good year .,xxbos this movie does not belong in a cinema . < xxrep 5 s > it belongs in a museum of modern art running in a continuous loop . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- at least `` melancholia '' has a plot . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- terrence malick 's ruminations on the difficulty of balancing nature & grace is beautiful bore . < xxrep 5 s > there are images in this film that are as breathtaking as any i ' ve ever seen in cinema . < xxrep 5 s > the 19 minute sequence that depicts `` creation '' is easily worthy of favorable comparison to `` 2001 '' 's `` voyage beyond infinity '' sequence . < xxrep 5 s > i was practically floating out of my chair while watching -- experiencing -- it . < xxrep 5 s > it also features a couple of brief dinosaur scenes which surpass any in `` jurassic park '' in terms of sheer realization & beauty . < xxrep 5 s > this portion of the film was definitely worth the effort put into creating it . < xxrep 5 s > but there are 2 other hours of this film which occasionally stir emotions & do n't really connect to anything except malick 's own cosmic navel gazing . < xxrep 5 s > i love `` 2001 '' , `` walkabout ' , `` '' & `` brazil '' . < xxrep 5 s > `` the tree of life '' shares these films uniqueness & sense of wonder but did n't connect with me on a deeper level like them . < xxrep 5 s > call me a low brow , but i 'll take `` caption america : the first avenger '' over this film any day .,xxbos the first nominees for next year 's oscars in the best picture , best actress , best supporting actor , best director , best original or adapted screenplay and best costume design categories have already been secured with the arrival of `` erin brockovich '' . < xxrep 5 s > julia roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in u.s . history . < xxrep 5 s > she would ' ve stole every scene if it was n't for her co - star albert finney who matches her for every . < xxrep 5 s > he plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight . < xxrep 5 s > although her box office says otherwise i ' ve always thought roberts was way overrated as a movie star . < xxrep 5 s > now i ' m a believer . < xxrep 5 s > she is smart , sassy , foul - mouthed , fiery , sensitive , funny and , of course , very sexy . < xxrep 5 s > it is one of best performances i ' ve ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of susan sarandon 's annie savoy from `` bull durham '' in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- of course annie savoy is purely fictional whereas erin brockovich is not . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i sense that her character may appeal more to men than women -lrb- her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film -rrb- . < xxrep 5 s > the reviews i ' ve read have been excellent , but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well . < xxrep 5 s > finney 's work is more nuanced than roberts ' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions . < xxrep 5 s > aaron eckhardt deserves mention too as roberts ' good guy biker boyfriend . < xxrep 5 s > these performances are made possible by a superb script from susannah grant . < xxrep 5 s > her fact - based tale of a small -lrb- hick -rrb- town poisoned by a giant utility has `` rocky '' - like xxunk in it and they feel all earned . < xxrep 5 s > the fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings . < xxrep 5 s > director steven soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated `` out of sight '' . < xxrep 5 s > this is an `` adult '' movie in the very best sense of that term . < xxrep 5 s > `` erin brockovich '' is definitely a big hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it . < xxrep 5 s > it also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly . < xxrep 5 s > it is the first best picture nominee for next year .,xxbos my expectations for writer / director m. night shyamalan 's next movie after `` the sixth sense '' were extremely high and `` unbreakable '' did not let me down . < xxrep 5 s > in fact , in some respects , it is a better and more self assured movie than the former . < xxrep 5 s > like `` 6th '' , `` un '' is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and i 'll be damned if i ' m gon na give anything away here . < xxrep 5 s > however i will say that bruce willis and samuel l. jackson -lrb- has this guy ever given a bad performance ? < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- are outstanding as the leads . < xxrep 5 s > there is not a wasted role in the movie . < xxrep 5 s > shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality . < xxrep 5 s > the spirit of rod serling lives in him . < xxrep 5 s > his direction and writing are a xxunk blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions . < xxrep 5 s > he is aided greatly by james newton howard 's brilliant score and eduardo xxunk 's daring cinematography . < xxrep 5 s > this movie takes more chances than `` 6th '' . < xxrep 5 s > you either buy it or you do n't . < xxrep 5 s > it has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust . < xxrep 5 s > `` un '' does n't benefit from `` 6th '' 's shock value , but i think is a more accomplished piece overall . < xxrep 5 s > it and `` erin brokovich are clearly this year 's 2 best movies .\n",

< xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > angelina jolie and dan xxunk and the entire cast take us through what happened in the search for danny pearl that we did not see or hear about in the press as they frantically tried to find him before he was so brutally killed . < xxrep 5 s > a very poignant love story with a horrific ending . < xxrep 5 s > kudos to marianne pearl and angelina jolie and brad pitt who produced the movie .,xxbos my wife and i see over 100 movies a year , having been in the business and now retired . < xxrep 5 s > we do not read any reviews by anyone . < xxrep 5 s > we try to tell our friends that a critic is one person , he or she is not us . < xxrep 5 s > critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear . < xxrep 5 s > therefore , our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre . < xxrep 5 s > many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction . < xxrep 5 s > how can you review a movie without the real deal ? < xxrep 5 s > a great movie with all three stars giving academy award performances amy adams , mark wahlberg and christian bale . < xxrep 5 s > one of the best fight films we have ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > amy adams does her usual fabulous job in still another type of roll . < xxrep 5 s > wahlberg has become a terrific actor and director and christan bale steals the movie with his great acting . < xxrep 5 s > do n't miss it .,xxbos we see over 75 movies a year and have not rated one a perfect 10 for over 3 years . < xxrep 5 s > this is the perfect movie . < xxrep 5 s > pixar is amazing . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the storyline to the characters to the unbelievable graphics are spectacular . < xxrep 5 s > hats off to pixar may they strike a new deal with disney and keep them coming . < xxrep 5 s > never expected them to top toy story , then toy story ii and now this is even better . < xxrep 5 s > wow !\n",

       "xxbos edward norton is right & wrong . < xxrep 5 s > this movie could have used more of him in it -lrb- when the dvd comes out i hope they include `` his cut '' if it exist -rrb- , but he is wrong for not promoting this movie . < xxrep 5 s > this re - boot is a blast to watch . < xxrep 5 s > i actually liked much of ang lee 's version but only in fits & starts . < xxrep 5 s > this hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags . < xxrep 5 s > the fx are spectacular & sometimes inspired -- every part of the production is great . < xxrep 5 s > the battle scenes are ferocious . < xxrep 5 s > i never tired of watching mean green do his thing , but i guess that s the point . < xxrep 5 s > the movie makers knew when to cut the action . < xxrep 5 s > however -- like iron man -- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism , but , come to think of it , all 3 xxunk & x - men + batman begins -lrb- & returns -rrb- also featured really fine & often great acting . < xxrep 5 s > and this hulk could ' ve used more of it . < xxrep 5 s > norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working . < xxrep 5 s > there are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief . < xxrep 5 s > william hurt makes a fine foe . < xxrep 5 s > and , so help me movie gods , liv tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name `` bruce '' . < xxrep 5 s > overall this movie rocks . < xxrep 5 s > and i thought all movies released xxunk july 18th were just until the dark knight arrives . < xxrep 5 s > thank you tony stark , indy & bruce banner for proving me wrong .,xxbos it is no surprise that gary ross -- the writer of big and dave -- once again brings a very smart comedy to the big screen , but what is surprising is the level of directorial xxunk that he brings to a very complex undertaking . < xxrep 5 s > pleasantville is a wonderful laugh - out - loud satire that deals with issues such as racism , fascism , artistic freedom , individuality , sexual mores , 90 's amorality , group control and some other things i probably missed . < xxrep 5 s > but ross wraps his messages in ambiguity and , most importantly , entertainment . < xxrep 5 s > any movie that uses don knotts effectively has really got its wits about it . < xxrep 5 s > the performances from every single actor -- including extras -- are kubrickian in their perfection and often hilarious . < xxrep 5 s > tobey maguire , reese witherspoon and joan allen are standouts in this standout cast . < xxrep 5 s > maguire is very good at showing the thought processes going on inside his head behind his eyes . < xxrep 5 s > witherspoon 's vixen is devious without being mean . < xxrep 5 s > and allen , like she did in face / off , brings a heart and soul that is key to the amazing things going on around her and to her . < xxrep 5 s > this movie tops there 's something about mary on the laugh meter and furthermore the way allen 's scene in the bathtub pays off is as outrageous as ... mary 's hair gel scene . < xxrep 5 s > the first hour of this movie is as funny as anything i ' ve ever seen . < xxrep 5 s > i have n't even mentioned the `` look '' of this film yet . < xxrep 5 s > it is fantastic . < xxrep 5 s > the seamless blend of color and black - and - white ceases to become an issue very early on . < xxrep 5 s > you accept this parallel universe for what it is and that is the highest compliment you can pay to the effects crew . < xxrep 5 s > fortunately ross does n't miss any opportunity to use it for laughs and social comment . < xxrep 5 s > some people have criticized the movie for waffling on the themes it speaks to , but i feel that any ambiguity that ross built into the script was simply meant to avoid any preaching and let the audience make up its own mind about what the movie means . < xxrep 5 s > my only real criticism of pleasantville is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good , but i 'd much rather have a movie that tries too hard than too little . < xxrep 5 s > next to saving private ryan this is my favorite film this year so far .,xxbos there are a handful of truly excellent movies that i only want to experience once and this is one of them . < xxrep 5 s > michael cimino 's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing . < xxrep 5 s > the survivors suffer more than the dead . < xxrep 5 s > i know a lot of knee - jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into cimino 's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the star spangled banner -lrb- or another `` patriotic '' song -rrb- , but i saw it as a ironic , if not sardonic , touch . < xxrep 5 s > this film could have been set in any war . < xxrep 5 s > i did n't see it as being specifically about vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of russian roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction . < xxrep 5 s > -lrb- i could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not -- all i know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul . < xxrep 5 s > -rrb- i was moved to tears by it . < xxrep 5 s > and of course the acting was brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > deniro gives one of best performances ever -lrb- and that is saying a lot -rrb- and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast . < xxrep 5 s > but as powerful as deniro is who can ever forget christopher walken 's shattering performance in his oscar winning role ? < xxrep 5 s > the effect that man 's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history . < xxrep 5 s > his death was real shocker -lrb- in a very bad sense -rrb- and i do n't even like remembering it as i write this . < xxrep 5 s > the xxunk is easily one of the top 20 films i ' ve ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick . < xxrep 5 s > its oscars were richly deserved .,xxbos 2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and i. million dollar baby is a sure fire xxunk award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win . < xxrep 5 s > everything about this movie from the writing , directing , acting and even the music by clint eastwood is brilliant . < xxrep 5 s > hillary swank is once again one of our best actresses . < xxrep 5 s > . < xxrep 5 s > do n't know why she does n't make more movies and do some as a `` real lady '' which she certainly is . < xxrep 5 s > her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role . < xxrep 5 s > the chemistry between her and the fabulous clint eastwood who i believe is past 70 years old is wonderful . < xxrep 5 s > clint is simply great in anything that he does , from those old spaghetti westerns , to dirty harry to the comedies , acting , directing , singing , you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else . < xxrep 5 s > he is a fall back to the greats of hollywood . < xxrep 5 s > what can you say about morgan freeman . < xxrep 5 s > i can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied . < xxrep 5 s > he is mesmerizing with his tones . < xxrep 5 s > as an actor , he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting . < xxrep 5 s > he is one of the finest actors in hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber . < xxrep 5 s > he is great as the go between with clint eastwood and hillary swank in this movie and he does it with such ease . < xxrep 5 s > i would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves .,xxbos we start all of our reviews with the following information . < xxrep 5 s > my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years . < xxrep 5 s > recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! < xxrep 5 s > so we can see whatever we want whenever we want . < xxrep 5 s > the point of this is that critics count for zero . < xxrep 5 s > your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me . < xxrep 5 s > the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! < xxrep 5 s > we never ever listen or read the critics . < xxrep 5 s > we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . < xxrep 5 s > well enough about that . < xxrep 5 s > a very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms . < xxrep 5 s > dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick . < xxrep 5 s > meryl streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the `` super bitch '' of the fashion magazine business . < xxrep 5 s > stanley tucci is his usual wonderful self as the `` gay '' assistant . < xxrep 5 s > anne hathaway continues to grow as an actress .\n",

    "Apparently, this looks way better than \"Plan A\". I trained the language model using AWD_LSTM, and I trained the classifier using also AWD_LSTM, which makes those two models big yet powerful. With the size of almost 20 times as \"Plan A\", I managed to get the loss down to 68% of \"Plan A\".\n",
